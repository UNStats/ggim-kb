Cybercartography is a new multimedia, multisensory and interactive online cartography and its main products are cybercartographic atlases using location as a key organizing principle. These atlases create narratives from a variety of different perspectives and include both quantitative and qualitative information. These include stories, art, literature and music as well as socio-economic and environmental information. GCRC research includes: cybercartography, polar research, multisensory cartography (e.g. sound and olfaction), cin\u00e9matographie, indigenous knowledge, participatory cartography, archiving and preservation, open source technologies and interoperability, the management of geographic information, and Global Map.",

UN-GGIM created a Working Group for a Global Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF), who formulated and facilitated a draft resolution for a Global Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF), which was adopted by UN-GGIM in July 2014 and ECOSOC in November 2014. On 26 February 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the UN resolution on Global Geodetic Reference Frame for Sustainable Development that was led by the Republic of Fiji. The Global Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF) is a generic term describing the framework which allows users to precisely determine and express locations on the Earth, as well as to quantify changes of the Earth in space and time. Most areas of science and society at large depend on being able to determine positions at a high level of precision. At present the GGRF is realized through the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and physical height systems.

An important reference document, \u201cFuture trends in geospatial information management- the five to ten year vision\u201d, has been prepared and posted on the UN-GGIM website. It has been appreciated by many users and keeps the professional geospatial community abreast of new trends in geospatial information and particularly with the impact of these geospatial technologies. The first version was published in 2013 and has since been translated into all six official languages plus Korea and Japanese. Besides, the updated version has been available in 2015. Thus, it was decided to create a new item to be added to the knowledge base on the \u201cFuture Trends\u201d. The version in 2013",

The analysis was carried out by ISPRS (by Prof. Gottfried Konecny) and the initial results concerned 91 responses (from 90 UN Member States and 1 from Northern Ireland) that have been received as of the end of May 2013. In terms of the number of responses from the various regions, Europe has provided 36 responses, followed by the Americas (15), Africa (20), and by Asia and the Pacific (19). The responses cover only about 50% of the global land areas, and without the coverage of the ocean areas which constitute 2/3 of the globe (See results in the report E/C.20/2013/15/Add.1 presented to the 3rd session of UN-GGIM, held in Cambridge in July 2013).\r\n It is worth noting that additional countries have responded and, as of the end of May 2014, the total number is 105 countries.\r\n"

The Australian Bureau of Statistics was tasked to carry out this programme review in 2012, and to conduct a survey on the status of the integration of statistical and geospatial information within National Statistical Offices (NSO) globally. In total, 53 countries participated in the survey and the responses provided a wealth of information to the programme review which was presented for discussion to the forty-fourth session of the Statistical Commission, held in February 2013.

Over the years, United Nations continues to move the UN-GGIM towards fulfilling its important mandate to enhance collaboration between Member States and to assist in making accurate, reliable and authoritative geospatial information readily available to support national, regional and global development and the important sustainable development agenda. And the UN-GGIM successfully dealt with strategic issues, such as sharing of geographic information and geospatial data resources, the education and training of geographical information science, the enhancement of the global geodetic reference frame, the development of global mapping for sustainable development; the establishment and implementation of geospatial standards; the linkage of geospatial information to statistics; and the definition of a shared statement of principles for the global geospatial community.
