Over the years, United Nations continues to move the UN-GGIM towards fulfilling its important mandate to enhance collaboration between Member States and to assist in making accurate, reliable and authoritative geospatial information readily available to support national, regional and global development and the important sustainable development agenda. And the UN-GGIM successfully dealt with strategic issues, such as sharing of geographic information and geospatial data resources, the education and training of geographical information science, the enhancement of the global geodetic reference frame, the development of global mapping for sustainable development; the establishment and implementation of geospatial standards; the linkage of geospatial information to statistics; and the definition of a shared statement of principles for the global geospatial community.

UN-GGIM created a Working Group for a Global Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF), who formulated and facilitated a draft resolution for a Global Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF), which was adopted by UN-GGIM in July 2014 and ECOSOC in November 2014. On 26 February 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the UN resolution on Global Geodetic Reference Frame for Sustainable Development that was led by the Republic of Fiji. The Global Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF) is a generic term describing the framework which allows users to precisely determine and express locations on the Earth, as well as to quantify changes of the Earth in space and time. Most areas of science and society at large depend on being able to determine positions at a high level of precision. At present the GGRF is realized through the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and physical height systems.

They established in November 2013 an Expert Group on the Integration of Statistical and Geospatial Information (UN-EG-ISGI) to carry out work on developing a statistical-spatial framework as a global standard for the integration of statistical and geospatial information.

An important reference document, “Future trends in geospatial information management- the five to ten year vision”, has been prepared and posted on the UN-GGIM website. It has been appreciated by many users and keeps the professional geospatial community abreast of new trends in geospatial information and particularly with the impact of these geospatial technologies. The first version was published in 2013 and has since been translated into all six official languages plus Korea and Japanese. Besides, the updated version has been available in 2015. Thus, it was decided to create a new item to be added to the knowledge base on the “Future Trends”. The version in 2013

With leadership from Ordnance Survey, United Kingdom, this new updated report is been prepared through a global consensus process. As well as exploring new areas, the version highlights changes to the trends identified in the original report, showing how the role of governments is changing, and documenting the increasing role of data collection technologies and processes.

According to the Rio+20 outcome document, ‘The Future We Want’, specifically recognized the importance of “reliable geospatial information” in the areas of national disaster risk reduction strategies and plans (including comprehensive hazard and risk assessments), and for sustainable development, policymaking, programming and project operations. Geospatial information is ubiquitous and can be applied to support every aspect of national development: development and planning; health care and social intervention; disaster management and climate change; crime management; infrastructure management; land management; natural resource management; agriculture; education administration; business; and environmental management.

In this regard, the UN-GGIM Secretariat prepared (one of them in collaboration with ISPRS) and sent out questionnaires inviting national geospatial information authorities organisations to participate in a global surveys that seek to capture the present status of geospatial information management, in terms of status of mapping, geodetic reference frame, institutional arrangements, and integration of geospatial and statistical information.

The analysis was carried out by ISPRS (by Prof. Gottfried Konecny) and the initial results concerned 91 responses (from 90 UN Member States and 1 from Northern Ireland) that have been received as of the end of May 2013. In terms of the number of responses from the various regions, Europe has provided 36 responses, followed by the Americas (15), Africa (20), and by Asia and the Pacific (19). The responses cover only about 50% of the global land areas, and without the coverage of the ocean areas which constitute 2/3 of the globe (See results in the report E/C.20/2013/15/Add.1 presented to the 3rd session of UN-GGIM, held in Cambridge in July 2013).
 It is worth noting that additional countries have responded and, as of the end of May 2014, the total number is 105 countries.

The global geodetic questionnaire, requested by the Committee of Experts, was initially drafted by the Geodetic Reference Framework for Sustainable Development Working Group of UN-GGIM-AP, and further developed at a technical workshop on the margins of the UNRCC-AP held in Bangkok, October 2012. As of 16 May 2013, there were 99 questionnaire responses from 95 countries (multiple organizations from the same country completed individual surveys) which have been analyzed by the Regional Committee of United Nations Global Geospatial Information for Asia and the Pacific and the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). These include responses (percentages are calculated from the global total of countries, not by countries the questionnaire was originally sent to) from Europe (38), Asia (16), Africa (15), Middle East (10), Caribbean (5), Pacific (4), South America (4), and North America (3). See results in the report E/C.20/2013/4/Add.1 presented to the 3rd session of UN-GGIM, held in Cambridge in July 2013.

Figure 1 in the attached Annex shows the number of responses from Member States per region is as follows: Europe (20); Asia & Pacific (13); Americas (11); Africa (9); Middle East (5). The objective of the global survey is to capture the status of geospatial information management to create a Member State profile that describes the organisational, technological, data and standards, legal and capacity characteristics of their national geospatial information management activities in order to help shape the strategic direction for the work of the Committee of Experts. The continued information gained should serve as a measure for the Committee’s progress and used to promote general awareness of geospatial information management initiatives across Member States.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics was tasked to carry out this programme review in 2012, and to conduct a survey on the status of the integration of statistical and geospatial information within National Statistical Offices (NSO) globally. In total, 53 countries participated in the survey and the responses provided a wealth of information to the programme review which was presented for discussion to the forty-fourth session of the Statistical Commission, held in February 2013. In terms of the number of responses from the various regions, Europe has provided (24) responses, followed by Asia and the Pacific (13), Africa (9), and by the Americas (8).
