In 2006, the Swedish Parliament approved legislation that officially appointed Lantmäteriet as the coordinator for the Swedish NSDI and setup the Geodata Advisory Board. The Swedish Geodata Strategy was adopted as the central strategy document on the development of the Swedish NSDI. The implementation of the Swedish Geodata Strategy and the INSPIRE directive is embedded in other initiatives, such as the government’s e-governance strategy. 8 action areas are identified as separate work packages in the Strategy:


• Co-operation in networks as a basis for the infrastructure, with priority given to the development of models for activities and agreements. The identification of areas of application that have a significant potential.


• The structuring of information, including the development of a basic framework containing descriptions of rules and methods for a service-oriented exchange of information and which describes geodata, defines the geodata sector and takes into account the requirements of the Inspire directive.


• The technical infrastructure, including the establishment of a geodata portal for a development environment, standardised interfaces and a national service catalogue.


• A national metadata catalogue, including a national programme for the creation of metadata.


• Geodetic reference systems and an accelerated transition to the new national reference system, Sweref 99.


• Research and development (R&D) and education including the formulation of a national R&D and education programme.


• Legislation, including an investigation of the possible need for changes and adaptation to Inspire.


• Financing and price-setting, including the development of financing and flexible pricing models and the implementation of cost-benefit analyses.


In the course of 2010, a number of legislative acts were adopted implementing the INSPIRE directive in Swedish law: 


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Sweden K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15


• Act 2010:1767 on geographic environmental information.


• Act 2010:1768 amending Act 2009:400 on public access to information and secrecy;


• Act 2010:1772 amending Act 2000:224 on the Cadastre;


• Ordonnance 2010:1771 amending Ordonnance 2009:946 on the tasks of the National Land Survey;


• Ordonnance 2010:1770 on spatial environmental information.


**Public-private partnerships**


Some private companies (e.g. T-kartor, Liber) are data producers for certain parts of the NSDI and service providers for some forms of geographic information. Thus in Sweden private commercial firms are involved in building the NSDI in different ways. They can be contracted for development works or production works, but also as vendors. Normally, private commercial firms are making “value-added” products out of core data. For instance, Lantmäteriet supports the establishment of value added resellers (VARs). 


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information**


Further to the Nordic tradition of open access to government files, the citizen’s right of access to government documents is seen as a fundamental aspect of Swedish society. It was first introduced in 1766 by a forerunner to the Freedom of the Press Act (FOI legislation) from 1948. The Freedom of the Press Act provides for access to documents kept by a public authority (e.g. the parliament, the government, state agencies and municipalities), including electronic documents. Access to documents is free of charge. The citizen also has a right to get a copy of the document or an extract from an electronic document. The fee for the copy should respond to the cost for producing the copy (marginal cost). There is no obligation to make available records for electronic data processing in any form other than printouts. Access can be denied only with reference to a specific clause in legislation demanding secrecy (the 2009 Secrecy Act). The purpose of request – commercial interests or not – is not relevant. In general private legal entities controlled by the crown with public tasks are not subject to the access regulations contrary to municipal entities, which are under the access regulations.


Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information and Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI have been transposed into Swedish law. The Swedish authorities originally believed that no changes to the legislation were necessary to implement Directive 2003/98. After the European Commission had sent a letter of formal notice to the Swedish government for the incorrect transposition of the PSI directive a new Act has been adopted in July 2010. However, many registers and databases remain subject to separate legislation regulating their re-use, often under cost recovery prices.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Crown claims copyright to GI produced by and for the National Land Survey. The Lantmäteriet administers the copyright on behalf of the Crown. The Crown also claims the database right on GI on real estate registers information in certain cases. The municipalities, the biggest producer of maps in Sweden, also claim copyright and suigeneris protection to their maps and databases.


The current Swedish Copyright Act dates from 1960 (Law no. 729 of 30 December 1960, as last amended in 2009).


Article 49 of the Copyright Act provides for the protection of catalogues, tables or similar products that contain a large amount of items of information. Article 49 also details the sui generis protection for databases. The protection lasts for ten years after initial publication. The protection exists in addition to copyright. In addition to photographs being able to attract copyright (if original), all photographs are protected by an exclusive right of reproduction according to article 49a of the Copyright Act. This right subsists until 50 years after roduction.


Following article 9 of the Copyright Act, laws and other regulations, decisions by public authorities, reports by Swedish public authorities and translations of the aforementioned documents are not subject to copyright. The law specifically states that among others maps and drawings that form part of the documents listed in the first paragraph of article 9 are protected by copyright (if, of course, they meet the general criteria set for copyright  rotection). Although works of public authorities other than those mentioned above may be subject to copyright, there is a general right for everybody to access and get a copy of  them in accordance with the regulations in the Freedom of the Press Act (art. 26a). The documents can normally be used freely but there are a number of exceptions. Works that pertain to geographical information: maps, computer programmes, technical models, works which are the result of scientific research and works that are commercially exploited by public authorities may not be freely used (art. 26§ 3).


The 1993 Act on the Protection of Land Information contains provisions that limit the free production and distribution of certain types of GI. The purpose of this legislation is to regulate and control the use and dissemination of GI from national security-reasons. The production of aerial photographs is with the exception of smaller parts of the country free. Building databases with land information, dissemination of aerial photographs, certain maps and land-information in digital form is subject to approval of the authorities for reasons of national security.


Sweden has transposed the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society in May 2005. 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


On 24 October 1998 the Personal Data Act (1998:204) came into force and replaced the out-dated Swedish Data Act from 1973. The Personal Data Act is based on Directive 95/46/EC. Section 33 of the Act was amended in 1999 to implement the EU Directive on the transfer of personal data to a third country. Data protection applies to a large amount of government information, including the SPAR population database, certain types of statistics, certain types of real property information and geographical information (addresses, real estate unit umber), vehicle registries and VAT files. Sweden has transposed the 2002 directive on privacy and electronic communications into national law.


**Licensing framework**


The pricing model for fundamental geographic data is based on decisions by Parliament and Government. The board of Lantmäteriet decides its own framework for pricing and licensing, based on the overall model and economic targets decided by Government. Läntmateriet does not provide data directly to the users, but through resellers. However an increasing number of services are also directly available on Lantmäteriet’s website. The viewing services are free of charge, but downloading data is charged for. Data can only be bought for private use. For any other type of use, the customer service has to be contacted. Under the National Geodata Strategy, a licensing strategy was developed that makes a distinction between different users and types of use. This should be incorporated in the development of a business model. Public bodies participating in INSPIRE are subject to general terms and conditions and pay an annual fee that is defined in advance based on number of agreed parameters. Any other data providers and users should buy licences for a particular volume of data, a specific type of ata or a specific service. Developers of added-value products should purchase a refiner licence. They have to ensure that all end users have a licence before the launch of any new products, or purchase a licence through which the end user fee is paid in advance. Special conditions will apply for research and education, and for access by the general public."					Thursday, September 1, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Spatial Data Infrastructure of Uruguay (IDEuy) is an initiative of the National Executive Branch, coordinated by the AGESIC (Agency for the Management of Electronic Government and Information Society and Knowledge), which aims to position itself as an essential instrument to support decision-making through the use of geographic information. Since its inception, has sought to coordinate IDEuy, standaridze and make available geographic information generated in the country. This has been possible thanks to the valuable contribution made by public agencies on their contributions both in the information and technicians who have participated in working groups.


The beginning of the Spatial Data Infrastructure in Uruguay has been the result of an evolutionary process in which various institutions have participated.There have been several milestones that helped in the realization of the objectives. However, it can be considered that the creation of Spatial Data Infrastructure of Uruguay born with the sanction of the executive decree of June 16, 2006. It includes the need to create a National Cadastre and the coordination of spatial data infrastructure nationwide. In order to optimize the performance of IDEuy have been created within AGESIC two advisory groups: the CAHSIG and GTIDE. The first with a strategic vision while the second with a technical function. Some of the objectives to be achieved are:


- Compatibility between IG. - Avoid the lack of coordination, duplication of functions.


- Use human and material resources efficiently.


- Use common rules and standards for processes involving the handling of geographical indications."					Tuesday, July 5, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

In improving the administration of land reform and rural development, and transformation as a whole, the department has initiated policy shifts. These will assist in realizing the department’s commitment to taking the land reform and rural development priority mandate of government onto a new trajectory in line with the expectations of the citizens. The following are a few of the legislation pieces that the department has been working on.


**Geomatics Profession Act, Act 19 of 2013**


The Geomatics Profession Bill was passed by the National Assembly on 20 June 2013, and was assented to by the President on 9 December 2013 as Act 19 of 2013. The Act replaces the Professional and Technical Surveyors Act, 40 of 1984，which catered for surveyors but excluded geographical science professionals and mine surveyors. The Act makes provision for all Geomatics professionals, technologists and technicians. Furthermore, it will ensure that the professional council is more representative, while it places more emphasis on education and training, as well as the marketing of the profession to attract more people into it.


**Spatial Data Infrastructure Act, Act 54 of 2003**


The Spatial Data Infrastructure Act provides for the establishment of the South African Spatial Data Infrastructure and the Committee for Spatial Information. The primary purpose is to ensure the open sharing of spatial information among organs of State. The Act is currently under review and a draft Spatial Data Infrastructure Amendment Bill has been prepared and approved by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform for submission to the Cabinet. There has however, been further delays in this process. The amendments relate mainly to clarifying some definitions, making the process of appointing members of the Committee for Spatial Information easier, authorizing the Committee for Spatial Information to make policies and guidelines, and to provide for penalties for non- compliance with the Act, Regulations and official standards. Draft Regulations have also been prepared that will come into operation once the Spatial Data Infrastructure Amendment Bill is enacted. These Regulations are aligned to the Act and the envisaged Amendment Act.


**Deeds Registries Amendment Act, Act 34 of 2013**


The Deeds Registries Amendment Act was assented to by President on 14 December 2013. The Act amends the Deeds Registries Act, 1937. Among other things but not limited to, the Act provides discretion in respect of the rectification of errors in the name of a person or the description of property mentioned in deeds and other documents, the issuing of certificates of registered title taking the place of deeds that have become incomplete or unserviceable. The Act also provides for the substitution of an obsolete reference and an outdated heading. The Act further regulates the updating of deeds in respect of the change of names of companies, close corporations and the surnames of women. **Sectional Titles Amendment Act, Act 33 of 2013**


President Zuma signed the Amendment Act on 18 December 2013. The Act seeks to amend the Sectional Titles Act, Act 95 of 1986. The amendments include among other things but not limited to; the provision for further regulation of notification of the intended establishment of schemes and the sale of units to lessees, allowing for the cancellation of registered sectional plans in a prescribed manner, the cancellation of part of a section pursuant to an expropriation, the registration of a transfer of a part of the common property with the consent of the owners of the sections and the holders of registered real rights, regulation of the issuing of a certificate of registered sectional title in respect of a fraction of an undivided share in a section and the issuing of more than one certificate of real right of extension and more than one certificate of real right of exclusive use area.


**Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, Act 15 of 2014**


The Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, was signed into law by President on 29 June 2014. This historic event builds on other legislative achievements of the department in respect of land reform. The Act amends the Restitution of Land Rights Act, Act no. 22 of 1994 to provide for the re-opening of the land claims process which effectively propels the country forward in the quest to reverse the legacy of the 1913 Land Act. The State has re-opened the lodgment of claims to enable the excluded claimants to lodge claims. The re-opening of land claims will provide an opportunity to persons and communities that did not lodge claims by the cut-off date of 31 December 1998 to also benefit from the restitution programme."			http://ggim.un.org/knowledgebase/Attachment234.aspx?AttachmentType=1	Spatial Data Infrastructure Act (No. 54 of 2003) in South Africa.pdf	Tuesday, July 5, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information**


Access to public sector information in general is guaranteed by Law no. 172.015 (Gesetz vom 19. Mai 1999 über die Information der Bevölkerung (Informationsgesetz). Directive 2003/98/EC was implemented by the Act of 29 May 2008 on the re-use of public sector information (Gesetz vom 29. Mai 2008 über die Weiterverwendung von Informationen öffentlicher Stellen – Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz). Law no.814.02 on environmental information (Gesetz vom 22. Oktober 1992 über Umweltinformationen) provides access for every citizen to environmental information.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Act no. 231.1 of 19 May 1999 on Copyright (Gesetz vom 19. Mai 1999 über das Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte (Urheberrechtsgesetz, URG) protects works of literature and art. It explicitly protects photographic works and maps. It replaced the Act of 1928 on Copyright. The 2001/29/EC directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society was implemented through amendments in 2006. <http://web.eftasurv.int/search.aspx?ecRef=2001%2f29> There are no special regulations on legal protection of GI in Liechtenstein. All data of the NSDI are captured and maintained according to a private or public law.

In 1999, the Law on State Survey and Real Estate Cadastre was adopted and followed by implementing rules on the procedure for topographic surveys, the production of state maps and the state geodetic administration. In addition, the Parliament adopted the State Survey and Real Property Cadastre Programme for 2001-2005. In 2007, the State Geodetic Administration prepared a new law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre (Official Gazette no. 16/2007) and new Rules and Regulations on Topographic Survey and State Map Production (Official Gazette no. 109/2008). The law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre contains a separate chapter on SDI e.g. SDI-definition, data content, necessary services, institutional framework, metadata, …).. As during the adoption procedure of the law, the draft INSPIRE directive was available, the SDI chapter of the law was attuned to some of the provisions of the directive. However, not all provisions of the directive are included in the Law yet. This will be done in a next step. The law defines the NSDI as a set of measures, standards, specifications and services within the framework of e-government for enabling the effective collection, management, exchange and usage of the geo-referenced spatial data that are subject to the law. Under the law, the bodies that are part of the NSDI are responsible for the regular maintenance of their spatial data sets and services and have an obligation to make their sets and services available to the national geoportal. The law sets up an NSDI Council, Committee and Working Groups. In May 2007, the Croatian Government appointed the 15 members and the president of the council (Official Gazette no. 16/2007).  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Croatia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 12


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Topographic mapping was performed during the 1990s in cooperation with the private sector. Recently, PPPs have been developed on the basis of the law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre. A large part of the data production is outsourced to the private sector.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The Croatian Act on the Right of Access to Information was adopted in October 2003, on the basis of Article 88 of the Constitution. Under the Act, all information possessed, disposed of or controlled by bodies of public authorities have to be available to any interested beneficiary of the right to information. This right of access to information covers the right to seek and receive information and the obligation of public bodies to make access to the requested information possible or to publish information when there is no special request for them. Any domestic or foreign natural or legal person can obtain access to public information. Access to State Survey and the Real Property Cadastre data and documents, print-outs, aerial images and other documents is regulated separately by the law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights** 


The Copyright and Related Rights Act (O.G. 167/2003) replaced earlier legislation of 1999 and entered into force on 30 October 2003. The Act protects original intellectual creations in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, having an individual character, irrespective of the manner and form of its expression, its type, value or purpose. Photographic and cartographic works, drawings, plans, sketches and tables are explicitly protected. Copyright is excluded for official texts in the domain of legislation, administration, judiciary (acts, regulations, decisions, reports, minutes, judgments, standards, and the like) and other official works and their collections, which are published for the purpose of officially informing the public. Next to copyright, databases are also protected by a separate right of the producer of the database, in line with the provisions of the 1996 database directive.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Article 37 of the Croatian Constitution states that “everyone shall be guaranteed the safety and secrecy of personal data. Without consent from the person concerned, personal data may be collected, processed and used only under conditions specified by law. Protection of data and supervision of the work of information systems in the Republic EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Croatia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 13 shall be regulated by law. The use of personal data contrary to the purpose of their collection shall be prohibited”  The Croatian Act on Personal Data Protection is based on the constitution and dates from 2003 (Official Gazette, no. 103/2003). It has been brought in line with the European directive 95/46/EC on the processing of personal data. Two other acts should also be mentioned:


 the Regulation on the method of maintaining records on personal data filing system and the form of such records (Official Gazette, No. 105/04); and  the Regulation on the manner of storing and special measures of technical protection of the special categories of personal data (Official Gazette, No. 139/04)


**Licensing framework**


Under the law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre, a working group has been set up on spatial data sharing policies, with the task to coordinate, develop and maintain an interoperable and customisable licence model that allows the spatial data providers to define and publish access conditions for their data and services.

Turkey is currently working on implementing a strategy for the NSDI and preparing a proposal for a law on the spatial data infrastructure. The Prime Ministry for State Planning and Organization proposed a number of Action Items in the course of the e-Transformation Turkey Initiative during 2005 and 2006, to prepare the set-up of the NSDI:


 Action Item 47 (A Preliminary Work to setup the National GIS / NSDI) (Dec 4, 2003 –Feb 2005): this action item included a survey of stakeholders, the identification of problems and recommendations. The study was executed by the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre, in cooperation with public bodies, universities, the private sector and the municipalities (G. Yalcin, B. Erkek, S. Bakici and N. Ahn, Through Spatial Data Infrastructure in Turkey, <http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2009/papers/ts01b/ts01b_yalcin_etal_3460.pdf>).


 Action Item 36 (Policy& Strategy Document of the National GIS/NSDI) (May 2005 –Feb 2006). The goals of this item were to determine standards for classification data, metadata, producing, storing and sharing data; to prepare a strategy document, and to determine the requirements for the legal framework. This action item led to the following SDI vision: “to allow geospatial data users in the country on-line access to quality and up-to-date geospatial information they need for their geo-related decision support processes, projects and applications”. It identified responsibilities for the different data categories, and gave recommendations on standards and metadata. It proposed an independent national Committee for NSDI, and a special SDI unit within the National Mapping and Cadastral Agency. A strategy in 6 stages was proposed:


 o STAGE 1: Realize legal regulation covering Policy, data content and organizational responsibilities for the NSDI.


 o STAGE 2: Develop the National Spatial data Exchange Standard (UVDF) in compliance with ISO standards.


 o STAGE 3: Let the institutions prepare geospatial metadata for their area of responsibility and present at their metadata portals.


o STAGE 4: Let the NSDI Organizational Infrastructure (e.g. Committee or Unit) prepare geospatial data standards according to the NSDI policy and strategy document (i.e. Action Item 36 –Report) EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Turkey K.U.Leuven (SADL) 10


o STAGE 5: Let the institutions prepare geospatial data for their area of responsibility.


o STAGE 6: Let the institutions present their data their data portals according to the legal framework defined at Stage 1.


 Action Item 75 (Creating National GIS Infrastructure/ NSDI) - (Jul 2006 –Dec 2007) was the result of the National Information Society Strategy and its Action Plan for 2006-2010. Its objective was the establishment of the Geographic Information Infrastructure. Next to these Action items, the following instruments are also important:


 Municipality Law 5216 and Metropolitan Law 5272 oblige municipalities to build GIS and urban GIS


 Interoperability circular 2005: this contains standards to build information systems in all central and local public institutions (A. Aydinoglu, W. Quak, T. Yomralioglu, Some Spatial Data Management Issues towards Building SDI,


 <http://www.i3mainz.fhmainz.de/FIGWorkshop/programme2Dateien/TS%206.2_Aydinoglu,etc._Some%20Spatial%20Data%20Management%20Issues%20towards%20Building%20SDI.pdf>)


 2005 Cadastre law: this law gives a mandate to create the Turkish NSDI.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


PPPs between the public and the private sector for the operation of the cadastre are accepted in theory, but are not fully operational yet. The government is working together with the company Turksat to develop the Turkish SDI.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The Turkish law on the right to information dates from October 9, 2003. The object of the law is to regulate the procedure of the right to information according to the principles of equality, impartiality and openness that are the necessities of a democratic and transparent government. Next to the Act, a circular on 'The exercise of the right of petition and access to information' was issued by The Prime Ministry in 2004 (see


<http://www.epractice.eu/en/document/288415>).


The law on the right to information gives natural and legal persons the right to obtain information from public institutions and private organisations that qualify as public institutions.

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Turkey has had a modern copyright law since 1951. It was amended in 1995 in order to harmonize it with European Union copyright principles. The amended Copyright Law contains a number of significant improvements: expanding the term of protection to 70 years, broadening coverage to include software, and sharply increasing penalties for infringement. However, further amendments are needed to bring the law into compliance with TRIPs, Berne. In 2001, the Copyright law was amended in order to make it more compliant with international conventions.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Section Five of the 1982 Turkish Constitution is entitled “Privacy and Protection of Private Life”. Article 20 of the Turkish Constitution deals with the “Privacy of the Individual’s Life”, whilst article 22 deals with the “Secrecy of communication”. The Turkish Ministry of Justice has been working on data protection legislation for several years without success. In mid 2003, a draft law on the protection of personal data (Kisisel Verilerin Korunmasi Kanunu Taslagi) was completed. It is based on the 1981 Council of Europe Convention and Directive 95/46 on the protection of personal data. The draft was sent to the National Assembly in 2008, and it is still pending (<http://www.epractice.eu/en/document/288415>). The By-law on privacy in the telecommunications sector was adopted in 2004 and the By-law on electronic communication security in 2008.

The Freedom of Information Act was adopted in 2008, but it has not entered into force yet. This is planned for August 2010. The Government of Malta published a notice in July 2009, giving all the public authorities one year to prepare their asset lists as required by the Freedom of Information Act. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information in the Freedom of Access to Information had already been transposed in the Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment Regulations of 2005. These entered into force in May 2005. There is also other sectoral legislation, e.g. for archives and registries.

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The 2000 Copyright Act “to make new provision in respect of copyright and neighbouring rights and certain “sui generis” intellectual property rights in substitution of the provisions of the Copyright Act, Cap. 196” was amended in 2001 and 2003. It explicitly protects maps, plans, diagrams and three-dimensional works relative to geography, science or topography. Article 25 of the Copyright Act provides for a sui generis right in respect to databases. Regarding the copyright works of government and international bodies, article 6 of the Copyright Act stipulates that copyright shall be conferred by this article on every work which is eligible for copyright and which is made by or under the direction or control of the Government of Malta and also such governments of other States, international bodies


or other intergovernmental organisations as may be prescribed by the Minister responsible for the Industrial Property Office. The 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society was included in the Copyright act by the amendments of 2003.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Maltese Data Protection Act of 2001 came into force on 22 March 2002 and was amended in July 2003. It includes the rules prescribed by Directive 95/46 on the processing of personal data, and the 2002 Directive on privacy and electronic communications.


**Licensing framework**


Licenses are issued for certain data and services. In 2007, the National Mapping Agency has reviewed its licence fees within the Public Sector (the review was repeated in 2008 and 2009). This coincided with a shift towards a single contractual arrangement for each ministry, thus enabling a more cost effective, relationship for departments and entities within the respective Ministry’s portfolio. To support this initiative, MEPA has detailed its digital mapping product sets, and associated licence fees, in a manner which provides for easier, centralised, contracting in close liaison with a Ministry’s representative. Agreements with the Ministry of Health, the Elderly and Community Care (MHEC) and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Employment (MEYE) have already been signed.

The Government of the Republic Act lists the institutions which have executive power and defines the area of government for every ministry (e.g. for the Ministry of the Environment, the performance of tasks relates to land and databases containing spatial data, the management of the use, protection, recycling and registration of natural resources, the management of meteorological observation, nature and marine research, geological, cartographic and geodetic operations, the maintenance of the land cadastre and water cadastre, …). The executive agencies under each Ministry are also listed in the Act, e.g. the Land Board under the Ministry of the Environment. Every Ministry or Executive Agency has a statute which concretizes its area of activities and functions. The statute of the Ministry of the Environment can be found on its homepage ([http://www.envir.ee](http://www.envir.ee/)) Its functions include managing the use of natural resources and environment and nature protection, land related activities, keeping state registers. The statute of the Land Board can be found on [http://www.maaamet.ee](http://www.maaamet.ee/), and includes tasks in the field of land cadastre and geodesy andcartography. The Estonian Environment Information Centre ([http://keskkonnainfo.ee](http://keskkonnainfo.ee/)) maintains the environmental register and classificators, maintains environmental monitoring data, the dumping site register and data of protected sites and environmental resources.


The Database Act (last amended in 2007 and incorporated in the Public Information Act) provides procedures for possession, use and disposal of state and local government databases, provides general principles of maintenance of databases belonging to the state, local governments and persons in private law, and for release and use of their data. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Estonia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 General national registers are maintained (listed only spatial data related) regarding (Par.25) the population (residents) of the state, immovable property and other significant subjects. General national registers are established by corresponding Acts. State registers are established by a regulation of the Government of the Republic. The Act also defines supporting systems for the maintenance of databases:


1. The classification system;


2. The geodetic system;


3. The system of address details;


4. the system of security measures for information systems;


5. the data exchange layer of information systems.


6. the administration system of the State Information System.


Use of support systems for the maintenance of databases is mandatory upon maintenance of all state and local government databases.The Regulation on Geodetic System was passed 5 Feb. 2004 and entered into force 21 Feb. 2004 (see 2.3.3) and the Regulation on imposing of the system of address details was passed 20 December 2007 and entered into force 1 January 2008. ELB has started to establish a central address data management system. Under the Regulation, this management system is functional from 1 January 2009. The Regulation on the data exchange layer of information systems (passed 19 Dec. 2003, entered into force 1 Jan. 2004) impose common principles for managing and operation of the internet based technical and technological environment for secure data exchange (XRoad, spelled as ‘crossroad’, in Estonian X-tee). X-Road (http://www.ria.ee) enables to use databases registered in the State Register of Databases through a unified interface. Through X-Road citizens are able to view their personal data, public authorities can use targeted services (juridical unified administration of matters, editing data) and legal entities have a unified portal for interaction with public authorities. Databases including spatial components and joined with X-Road are among others the system of address details, Constructions Register, Title Book, Register of Objects of Cultural Heritage, Land Cadastre, Land Cadastre and Municipal Lands Register of the City of Tallinn. The INSPIRE directive was transposed by the adoption and amendment of several Acts. For an overview, see <http://eurlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:72007L0002:EN:NOT#FIELD_E>.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The ELB maintains several spatial databases (geodetic network, topographic maps, special maps), but it has only very small production capabilities (aerial works, photogrammetry) and a majority of the works (building and measuring of geodetic networks, cartographic production, software development) are outsourced through public procurements. The Department of Land Cadastre of ELB registers land and maintains the  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Estonia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 Land Cadastre. All actual land surveying works are however carried out by private surveyors or companies at landowners’ own expense. 


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


The Public Information Act (RT I 2000, 92, 597) was passed on 15 November 2000 and it came into force on 1 January 2001. The Act covers state and local agencies, legal persons in public law and private entities that are conducting public duties including educational, health care, social or other public services. The Act also includes significant provisions on electronic access. The Database Act was consolidated into the Public Information Act on 4 December 2007 and entered into force on 1 January 2008. The Act establishes the State Information System. Cadastral data are public and everyone has right to access the data, except the data about ownership. The right to use data is free of charge for state agencies and local governments. EU Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information and EU Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI have been implemented into Estonian law.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Copyright Act was passed 11 November 1992 (RT 1992, 49, 615; RT I 1999, 36, 469) and entered into force on 12 December 1992. The last amendments were made in 2007. In §4(17) of the Copyright Act it is stipulated that copyright exists in photographic works, whereas in §4(18) it is stipulated that copyright exists in cartographic works (topographic, geographic, geological, etc. maps, atlases, models). According to §5 of the Copyright Act legislation, administrative documents (acts, decrees, regulations, statutes, instructions, directives) and court decisions, and official translations thereof, are not protected by copyright law. Chapter VIII of the Estonian Copyright Act provides for special legal protection of databases. This chapter was inserted by the Act of 9 December 1999. The copyright and ownership of data and publications produced by ELB’s order belong to the Land Board.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The 1992 Estonian Constitution includes several statements on privacy. Article 22 states that ""Everyone has the right to the inviolability of private and family life. State agencies,  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Estonia  .U.Leuven (SADL) 20 local governments, and their officials shall not interfere with the private or family life of any person, except in the cases and pursuant to procedure provided by law to protect health, morals, public order, or the rights and freedoms of others, to combat a criminal offence, or to apprehend a criminal offender."" Article 42 protects against the governmentauthorized collection or storage of personal data without the citizen’s consent. The Personal Data Protection Act was passed on 12 February 2003 and entered into force on 1 October 2003. It was amended in Dec. 2007.


**Licensing framework**


Data from the Estonian Land Board can be viewed free of charge. Downloading is regulated by a Decree from the Ministry of Environment. A licence has to be signed, based on templates that can be found on the ELB website (<http://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Ordering-Data/Ordering-digital-map-datasetsp325.html>). The licence, together with an order form, has to be sent to the ELB. The data can be downloaded via ftp. Short term licences are concluded for one year and long-term licences for seven years. Four types of licence templates are available:


 Type 1: viewing, printing up to A3 for internal use


 Type 2: allowed use under type 1 + making derivative works, large scale hard copy printing, for internal use


 Type 3: allowed use under type 2 + selling derivate works without the original data

The Surveying Act and the Metrology Act form the legal basis for the activities of the BEV as a federal agency. The emphasis of the Acts is on cadastral activities. The coordinating role BEV is playing for the federal NSDI-initiatives has no formal legal basis but is the result of a within-government  greement. In July 2005, a Decree was issued implementing a central Address Registry (Addressregisterverordnung). The Decree organizes the technical aspects, the competences and rights of use and the division of costs between the federal level (BEV) and the municipalities. The municipality is the official “owner” of the data, while the BEV handles the administration and the distribution. For this, the BEV receives about 10% of the revenues .


The Federal Environmental Agency was founded as a separate state-owned corporation by the Umwelkontrollgesetz, which lays out its responsibilities and entered into force on January 1st, 1999. The Austrian government’s approach is to implement INSPIRE:


 (i) without modification of any competencies and responsibilities between federal government (“Bund”) and provincial governments (“Länder”);


 (ii) to stay with the decentralized data ownership and distribution; and


 (iii) to implement only what is strictly legally required (“no golden plating”). ` The current situation is that a federal implementation law was adopted by the Austrian  Parliament and is in force, 5 of the 9 Provinces have an SDI legislative act in force and 2 Provinces have it published. In March 2010, the Geodateninfrastrukturgesetz – GeoDIG was published in the Federal Law Gazette I No. 14/2010, transposing the INSPIRE directive. It entered into force on 2 March.

Article 20 of the Federal Constitution obliges the federal, provincial and municipal administration to give information on matters relating to their scope of activity, unless they are under a legal duty to maintain secrecy. This obligation is made operational by federal and provincial legislation. The Auskunftspflichtgesetz is a Freedom of Information law that obliges federal authorities to answer questions regarding their areas of responsibility. However, it does not permit citizens to access documents, just to receive answers from the government on the content of information. If an interest can be shown, then the individual requesting information can obtain copies of the documents under the Code of  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe State of play Spring 2011 Austria K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 Administrative Procedures or the Data Protection Act. The nine Austrian Provinces have laws that place similar obligations on their authorities. 


As far as environmental information is concerned, the Federal Law on Environmental Information adopted in 1993 implements the European Union Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment for information held by the federal government. It was amended to implement Directive 2003/4 in the course of 2004-2005 (Bundesgesetz über den Zugang zu Informationen über die Umwelt Umweltinformationsgesetz – UIG, BGBI. Nr. 495/1993 as amended BGBI. I Nr. 6/2005. The changes entered into force in February 2005. By decree of the Austrian Federal Minister of Economic Affairs of 24 June 1997 everybody is granted direct access to the cadastre and the land registry database via the public services of Telekom Austria AG, Datakom Austria AG, IBM Network Services and Bundesrechenzentrum GmbH. Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information has been transposed on the federal level and in the Länder. At the same time as the introduction of the federal legislation on re-use (Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz), the Surveying Act (Vermessungsgesetz) was changed. The new §48 concerns the delivery of geodata and their use for other purposes. In accordance with this act, BEV has introduced new conditions on standard charges and use of the data on 1 January 2006. These general conditions can be downloaded from

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Austrian Copyright Act (Urheberrechtsgesetz) dates from 9 April 1936 and has been amended several times since then. Paragraphs 73 to 76 of the Copyright Act provide for special protection for photographs. Whilst original photographs are subject to normal copyright regulation, all non-original photographs are also protected for thirty years after production or publication. Paragraph 7 of the Copyright Act stipulates that laws, decrees, judicial decisions and the like are not subject to copyright. In addition, all works of public entities produced exclusively or mainly for official use, cannot be subject to copyright. The latter provision should however be interpreted restrictively.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe State of play Spring 2011 Austria K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 Paragraph 7 of the Copyright Act also explicitly states that topographic works produced by the Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen can be subject to copyright. This is the case if they are original, destined for publication, and produced by the Bundesamt. Austria was one of the four countries that managed to implement European Directive 96/9/EC concerning the legal protection of databases in time, i.e. by 1 January 1998. The most recent amendment dates from 2003 and adapts the Copyright Act to the 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Austrian Data Protection Act (called Datenschutzgesetz) was enacted in 1978, creating the Data Protection Commission and the Data Protection Council. It is concerned with all personal data, but does not specifically recognise the concept of “sensitive” data. However, personal information may not be sold and public authorities are required to institute a system of control and sanction for infractions.There were however a number of differences between the Austrian DP Act and the European Directive, but these were for the most part addressed by the Austrian Federal Chancellery in a bill presented to Parliament in 1999, which was passed into law with effect from 1 January 2000. This Bundesgesetz über den Schutz personenbezogener Daten (Datenschutzgesetz 2000) applies to all processing by automatic means. Seven Länder have also adopted new data protection laws to implement the Directive. The Austrian legislation is fully compliant with Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications.


**Licencing framework**


A licensing framework is in use for BEV products. Since 2008, almost all products are available on-line on the BEV portal. A distinction is made between different shops (see <http://www.bev.gv.at/portal/page?_pageid=713,1576213&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL>

The legal framework for the Luxembourg SDI is very limited. The cadastre was organised mainly by the “Loi du 21 juin 1973 portant organisation de l'Administration du Cadastre et de la Topographie” and a number of subsequent regulations (<http://www.act.public.lu/fr/legislation/index.html>). A reorganisation was put in place by the law of 25 July 2002. In June 2010, the European Commission decided to take Luxembourg to the European Court of Justice for infringement of its obligation to transpose the directive (<http://ec.europa.eu/community_law/eulaw/decisions/dec_20100603.htm>). Shortly after, the INSPIRE Directive was transposed into national law: Loi du 26/07/2010 portant transposition de la directive 2007/2/CE du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 14 mars 2007 établissant une infrastructure d’information géographique dans la Communauté européenne (INSPIRE) en droit national4.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


No information has been found.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information (PSI)**


There is no general freedom of information law in Luxembourg. Under the 1960 Decree on state archives, the archives are to be open to the public, but people must make a written request explaining why they want access and ministers have broad discretion to deny requests. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information was transposed by the Law of 25 November regarding public access to environmental information (Loi du 25 novembre 2005 concernant l’accès du public à l’information en matière d’environnement, <http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/2005/2041912/2041912.pdf?SID=143d7626b0a51f7399c30822b3562e8c#page=2>). Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information was transposed by the Law of 4 December 2007 (<http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/docs/laws/luxembourg/lux_law_2007.pdf>).

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Luxemburg Copyright Act dates from 2001 and was modified in March 2004. It protects literary and artistic works, including photographs, databases and computer programs. Article 10 of the Copyright Law determines that official texts of the authorities, including their official translations, shall not give rise to copyright. This also includes the preliminary works, court decisions and political discussions. All other writings produced by the State, municipalities or public establishments shall give rise to copyright for a term of 70 years. There are no special regulations regarding the protection of geographical information. The Copyright Act transposes the 1996 directive on databases and the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society into Luxemburg law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Luxemburg Data Protection Law was adopted in 2002, in order to implement the European Data Protection Directive of 1995. In 2007, it was amended for the last time. The 2002 directive on privacy and electronic communications was transposed by the Law on Privacy in Electronic Communications"" of May 30, 2005 (Loi du 30 mai 2005 relative aux dispositions spécifiques de protection de la personne à l'égard du traitement des données à caractère personnel dans le secteur des communications électroniques).


**Licensing framework**


In March 2009, two regulations were adopted that regulate the conditions for access and delivery of cadastral data and cartographic, topographic and geodetic data (Règlement grand-ducal du 9 mars 2009 portant fixation des conditions et modalités de deliverance de la documentation cadastrale and Règlement grand-ducal du 9 mars 2009 portant fixation des modalités de mise à disposition et des tarifs des produits cartographiques, topographiques et géodésiques de l’administration du cadastre et de la topographie – see <http://www.act.public.lu/fr/legislation/diffusion-donnees/index.html>).


Cadastral extracts can be delivered digitally or on paper. Any reproduction of the data should mention the source and the date of validity. Digital data have to be requested in writing and the public authorities have to state the task in the public interest for which they need the data. Other natural or legal persons do not need to state an interest; they should only make a request in writing. For obtaining topographic, cartographic and geodetic data, an agreement has to be signed between the user and the administration fixing the details of delivery and the price. The rights of use are determined in the regulation. A distinction is made between different  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Luxembourg K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 types of use: internal use, external use by disseminating the data to contractors, reproduction of the data. The Luxembourgish Law stipulates that the data can be shared free of charge between all the public authorities. A set of non-secured OGC-compliant webservices (WMS/WFS) are available to all the people having access to the state network. Community institutions and bodies can access the data available in the LSDI through Webservices that can be opened case by case. Once a convention has been signed and a price fixed for the access to the data, Community institutions and bodies can access the data by using a HTTP BASIC login to the OGC compliant WMS / WFS services. Even if most of the data is not free of charge speaking in terms of download services, all the data can be viewed and queried free of charge in the geoportal’s viewer(S),"					Wednesday, June 15, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Since the mid-90s, there have been significant developments to develop a legal framework related to GI, including e.g. legislation establishing the registers on land and property (1996) and the responsibilities of NSGC (1997); legislation on the State registers (1996) and the population census (1997). A milestone for the development of GIS in Lithuania was the “Law on Geodesy and Cartography” which was adopted in 2001. The purpose of this law is to regulate the management of geodetic, topographic, and cartographic activities; the principles of creating databases of the GI systems and their integrity; the ownership of the geodetic control and cartographic material; and the main rights and duties of state and municipal institutions and enterprises involved in map production, geodetic survey, gathering of data, its record keeping, and use in the field of geodesy and cartography.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 During 2007 – 2010, a new version of the Law on Geodesy and Cartography was prepared which includes the transposition of the INSPIRE directive and Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market. The new law contains a definition of the Lithuanian SDI (LISI), and regulates public access to spatial data and services (unless other legislation applies). On 27 April 2010, the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania amended the (new) Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Geodesy and Cartography establishing the procedure for access to spatial data via the Lithuanian spatial information portal (LSIP). This law supplements the previous version of the Law with provisions on the use of LISI and LSIP. It covers the following issues:


- LISI spatial data themes;


- LSI portal regulations;


- LISP safety regulations;


- Security rules for the LSIP-management of digital information


- Continuity of LSIP activities


- LISI technical requirements


- Procedure for preparing and providing LISI metadata


- Procedures for monitoring LISI anr preparing/submitting reports to the European Commission.


The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Geodesy and Cartography defines the following conditions for the use and supply of spatial data sets via the LSIP:


- Access to spatial data via the Lithuanian spatial information portal must be public, unless access to spatial data is otherwise defined in other laws.


- Spatial data sets and services needed by European Union authorities, public authorities and municipalities for carrying out public tasks or submitting reports in accordance with uropean Union environmental legislation must be provided free of charge.


- State cadastre and register management bodies as well as state and municipal authorities managing spatial data sets have the right to restrict access to spatial data sets via the LSIP if this is written in other laws.


- Users of the spatial data sets and services of LISI must agree to the conditions established by spatial data and service suppliers or their authorised distributors.


- Spatial data set suppliers may be state cadastre and register management bodies or state or municipal authorities managing spatial data sets. Persons wishing to create value-added products using data from state cadastres, registers, georeferenced spatial data sets or spatial data sets and thematic spatial data sets must be entitled to do so in accordance with the procedure established by spatial data set suppliers. Value-added products must be supplied to users by authorised distributors in accordance with the procedure established by spatial data set suppliers.


- In accordance with the procedure set in legal acts, access to spatial data sets and/or services via the LSIP must be provided to Member States’ public authorities and enterprises and organisations that provide public services.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20


- Regarding payment services, the service provider must ensure that users from the Republic of Lithuania and other Member States are able to use e-commerce services. During the LIGI project, GIS-Centras prepared typical documents describing the conditions of supply and use of spatial data in Lithuania:


1. Agreements on the granting of distribution rights on spatial data products and on supply of spatial data products to the LISI. This is an agreement between the LSIP manager and a spatial data supplier. It presents the main terms, the legal basis of provision of spatial data and services via LSIP, the procedure for distributing spatial data services, the data supplier payment, the rights and obligations of the parties as well as the general procedure for providing spatial data and services to users. The annexes of the agreement contain structured forms with explanations for entering the descriptors of spatial data or services provided.


2. Model agreements on the use of spatial data and services. They set the main conditions for using spatial data and services based on which the LSIP manager makes licence agreements with the end users of spatial data and services. They provide for methods of approving licence agreements by a physical signature, electronic signature and clicking upon checking the person’s identity. The licence agreement sets the procedures for providing spatial data and related services to users, the purpose and conditions for use as well as the payment procedure.


3. Conditions for using LSIP-services. These services are publicly applicable and free of charge. They are constructed more simply than licence agreements. Finally, the Ministry of Agriculture and National Land Service under the Ministry of Agriculture (NLS) are responsible for a strategy implementing INSPIRE in Lithuania. There are some internal planning documents, which are used for communication to state data stakeholders and responsible authorities, but those documents are not approved as legal acts.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There are no real PPPs established in the domain of spatial data infrastructures in the Republic of Lithuania.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


On 2 July 1996 the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public (no. I-1418) was passed. The latest amendment to this law was made in July 2006. Article 6 of this law states that “Every individual shall have the right to obtain from State and local authority institutions and agencies and other budgetary institutions, public information regarding their activities, their official documents (copies), as well as private information about himself” and “State and local government institutions must, in accordance with the procedure established by the Law On the Right to Obtain Information from State and Local Government Institutions and other laws, furnish public information as well as  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 21 private information held by them, except in instances specified by laws, when private information is not to be divulged.” A version on the Law on State Registers has been in force since August 2004. The state registers are an important part of official public information. Currently the Law affects to more than 90 databases. In the near future this number of registers could increase to around 160. The law on State Registers defines the order of establishing, creation, managing, liquidation and distribution of the state registers. All data of the state registers are public and available for any citizen or legal person if it is not restricted by other specific laws. The data are available via Internet or could be downloaded by data flow channels. There is no standard license. The details of the distribution of the data of every register are described in the regulations of the register adopted by a Government Decree. The list of registers is available at [www.registrai.lt](http://www.registrai.lt/). Lithuania has transposed Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information.


Directive 2003/98 was transposed by the law of 10 November 2005 on Obtaining Information from Central and Local Government Institutions (Nr. X-383 of 10 November 2005). The law concerns the right of private companies and citizens to obtain information from central and local government and the re-use of it. The law defines the rights and modalities to use the information resources of public sector and also determines the obligation of central and local government to provide this kind of information to all concerned. There are currently no valid official agreements.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Law on Copyright and Related Rights (Act no. VIII-1185) was enacted on 18 May 1999, entering into force on 9 June 1999 (amendments were introduced by the Act of 20 July 2000 - no. VIII-1886). The Copyright Act was a major step forward for the legal regime in Lithuania. It was drafted taking into consideration the EU directives and provisions of the Bern and Geneva Conventions. In the last decade Lithuania has transformed its copyright law from the old Soviet-style one into a system that complies to a large extent with modern bilateral and multilateral standards. Chapter 4 of the Copyright Law contains special provisions on the legal protection of databases (sui generis right). The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society has been incorporated in Lithuanian legislation. Article 34 of the recent Law on Geodesy and Cartography of June 2001 contains special provisions regarding the copyright protection of GI. This article stipulates the following:


“The Republic of Lithuania shall be the copyright holder of the exclusive economic rights to official maps and digital databases financed from the state budget and foreign assistance for the Republic of Lithuania. The authorised institution shall, within the limits of its competence, administer the exclusive economic rights of the authors to official maps and georeferenced databases.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 22 The municipalities shall be the copyright holders of the exclusive economic rights of the authors to topographic maps, plans and georeferenced databases financed from the municipal budgets and shall, within the limits of their competence, administer the exclusive economic rights of the authors. For the use of official maps and georeferenced databases, publishing of thematic maps or development of institutional digital databases, with the exception of their use for defence needs, an author's fee shall be charged and a copyright licensing agreement shall be made with the user. The remuneration received as the author's fee shall be used for adjustment of official maps and georeferenced databases. The rights to cartographic works, thematic and other maps and databases shall be protected following the procedure under law. Original works of thematic cartography shall be regarded as research work and their publication shall be recognised as scientific publications.” Closely linked to article 34 are the stipulations made in article 7 on the ownership of geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials. Article 35 stipulates with regard to the procedure on the use of geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials: “Geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials and georeferenced data shall be public and available to any natural and legal persons and enterprises without the status of a legal person. The authorised institution and executive institutions of the municipalities shall provide to the consumers geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials and georeferenced data following the procedure established by the authorised institution and executive institutions of the municipalities. Fees for the materials and data shall be charged in the manner stipulated by laws.”


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Lithuania enacted its Law on Legal Protection of Personal Data in 1996. This law has been amended several times throughout the years. The latest amendment dates from 22 January 2002, as to ensure the compliance of the act with the EU Directives on data protection. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications still has been transferred into national law. The Law on the Public Registers of 13 August 1996 (no. I-1490) determines the rights and duties of the institutions responsible for the management of public registers, the institutions directing their activities and exercising supervision over them, the rights and duties of the legal and natural persons providing data to the public registers as well as using the data of public registers, and the protection of these rights. It also determines the rights and duties of legal and natural persons whose data constitutes the object of the public registers and the protection of said rights. Referring to article 23, section 4 of the Law on Geodesy and Cartography public institutions, responsible for administration of state registers, cadastres, state and EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 23 municipal institutions, responsible for management of spatial datasets have rights to limit an access to spatial datasets via LSIP if such described in other laws.


**Licensing data framework**


The Law on Geodesy and Cartography lists a number of geodetic, topographic and cartographic activities that should be carried out. These activities are subject to licensing, and the licences for these activities shall be issued by the National Land Service. The National Land Service arranges the concession of licences for cadastral survey products, topography, geodesy and cartography activities. It administers the funds provided for these purposes. Regarding LSIP, data sets are available under a licensing policy that allows a large part of the procedure to be performed in an automated way (see section 2.3.1). Standard agreements and licences are developed for different groups of stakeholders, with a description of the use conditions. LSIP lists the terms and conditions of the use of the data. It also presents the privacy statements describing the LSIP usage in general. Each spatial data set or service in LSIP is delivered to the end user by signing a licence agreement. Signing can be achieved in several ways: analogue (physical) signature, electronic signature or accepting license conditions on-line."					Wednesday, June 15, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The process of establishing SNIG (Sistema Nacional de Informação Geográfica) started in February 1986, with the publication of decision SEIC 2/86 of the Secretary of State for Research and Development. It created a task force -consisting of the representatives of the main actors in the GI area- whose mission was to study the creation of a national SDI and to propose to the Secretary of State the corresponding actions to be taken by the Government. As a result of the studies and activities carried out by this task force, the Portuguese SNIG was created in 1990 through Decree-Law no. 53/90. This law also established the CNIG (Centro Nacional de Informação Geográfica) as a governmental EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Portugal K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 research centre with the mission of coordinating and implementing the SNIG (CNIGwebsiteis no longer online). Since its inception, the SNIG was intended to become the focal point of geospatial data distribution and accessibility in Portugal. It was conceived as a fully distributed system consisting of nodes that serve data or metadata online, and was launched on the Internet in May 1995.


In 2001 the Portuguese government -in order to improve the efficiency of the public administration- decided to create the Instituto Geográfico Português (IGP) by merging CNIG with IPCC (Portuguese National Geodetic, Mapping and Cadastre Agency). The IGP was created in January 2002 and its organic law published by the Decree-Law no. 53/2002. The transposition of the INSPIRE directive was embedded in the revision of the existing law 53-90 on the SNIG (DL - Decreto-Lei n.º 180/2009, 7 August 2009, <http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2009/08/15200/0513205139.pdf>).


The same Decree-Law nr. 180/2009 created the National Registry for Geographic Information and provided the set-up of the Advisory Council of the National Geographic Information System (CO-SNIG) responsible for the coordination of the INSPIRE implementation.


It should be noted that Azores and Madeira are autonomous regions developing their own SDs: IDEiA (Azores) and IRIG-Madeira. 


**Public-private partnerships (PPP’s)**


No information available. 


For the SDS of Portuguese maritime heritage, cooperation has been established with private and public, local and national bodies, in particular collaboration arrangements with the Centre for Overseas History (CHAM/UNL), the Labour and Business Sciences Institute (ISCTE) and theTropical and Scientific Research Institute (IICT). 


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


Article 268 of the Constitution determines that citizens shall enjoy the right to have access to administrative records and files, subject to the legal provisions with respect to internal and external security, investigation of crime and personal privacy. Law no. 65/93 (Lei de Acesso aos Documentos Administrativos) of 26 August 1993 (as amended by Law no. 8/95 of 29 March 1995 and by Law no. 94/99 of 16 July 1999) provides for this access to government records. The law is overseen by the Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (Comissão de Acesso aos Documentos Administrativos), an independent parliamentary agency. This Commission can examine complaints, give opinions on access, and decide on classification of systems (http://www.cada.pt). EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Portugal K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been transposed into Portuguese law by Law 19/2006 of 19 June 2006 ([http://www.cada.pt/uploads/7f000001- a20b-9451.pdf](http://www.cada.pt/uploads/7f000001-%20a20b-9451.pdf)). Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI was transposed by Law 46/2007 of 24 August 2007


(<http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/docs/laws/portugal/pt_transposition_law.pdf>).


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Portuguese Copyright Act (Code of Copyright and Related Rights no. 45/85) dates from 17 September 1985 and has been revised since. It practically lists the same works eligible for protection as the Berne Convention. This includes geographical maps and illustrations and works related to geography or other sciences. The general description of the copyrighted material is: intellectual creations in the area of literature science and art. Collections of data are not specifically mentioned. The law only speaks of works such as anthologies and encyclopaedias. It is however doubtful whether GI datasets fall within the scope of the copyright act, since they are a collection of facts and not a collection of works. For GI in the form of digital maps, it may be argued that since paper maps enjoy protection, the same should apply to digital maps. Photographic work (e.g. aerial photograph) only qualifies for copyright protection if the selection of the object to be photographed and/or the way in which it is made, results in a personal artistic creation. Photography that is the basis for map production will in general not meet these demands. This does not necessarily mean that the map that results from the photography is not protected. The law on the production of products of cartography (Law no. 193/95 of 28 July 1995) states explicitly that copyright law applies to cartographic information. Notwithstanding copyright protection (for which originality is one of the requirements), article 14 sub 2 of this new law states that it is forbidden to use, supply to others, reproduce, divulge or commercialize cartographic products or the corresponding technical data without permission of the entity of which it is the property. It is clear that this law aims to give producers of GI additional protection besides copyright. By Decree Law 122/2000 of 4 July 2000 the EU Directive on the protection of databases was implemented into Portuguese law. The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society has also been transposed into Portuguese law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The system for access to personal information is regulated by both the Constitution (articles 37, 48 and 268 of the Constitution) and the law. Law no. 67/98 on the Protection of Personal Data of 26 October 1998 implements Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The supervisory authority is the National Data Protection Commission (Comissão Nacional de Protecção de Dados - http://www.cnpd.pt). The  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Portugal K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20 applicability of the above privacy legislation to the processing of GI depends largely on the interpretation of the concept of “personal data”. The 2002 Directive on privacy and electronic communications has been implemented in Portuguese law.


**Licensing framework**


Data sharing arrangements exist between public authorities and they differ accordingly their object and conditions like - data-sharing and collaboration agreements between public authorities e.g within the Regional Geographic Information Infrastructure (IRIG), the Regional Directorate for Geographic Information and Regional Planning Madeira has collaboration agreements with all the Municipalities and a large number of regional and national GI producers; - agreements in which information production costs are shared;- licences to use information; - information sharing arrangements with private bodies;


- data-sharing arrangements through Geo Web Services; e.g. Agriculture and Fisheries Financing Institute has Data-sharing arrangements via Web Services with the Vine and Wine Institute, with the Management Authority of the Rural Development Programme for the Mainland and with various insurers (harvest insurance);


- information exchange arrangements on certain themes;


- data model definition arrangements;


- application transfer arrangements;


- GI and tool transfer arrangements


Data from the IGP can be requested by filling out a standard form provided on the website (<http://www.igeo.pt/Frameset-egeo.htm>). Sometimes when the ownership of the data is shared between IGP and another public organization, the use by third parties is regulated by a pre-established protocol. For the Soil and Soil Capacity of Use Maps (1:25 000), public authorities have to sign a Term of Responsibility, emitted by the Direcção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DGADR), to be able to use that cartography. DGADR has different levels of charging for different users (e.g. public authorities with cooperation agreements, university and research, private companies, students)."

The ""Law of Cadastre and Real Estate Publicity"" (law no. 7/1996) regulates the activities in the domains of cadastre, geodesy and cartography and founded ANCPI, which is organized according to Government Decree No.1038/1996 and its subsequent modifications (Romanian Government Decree No. 98/1999). EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Romania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 13 The organisation and functioning of ANCPI, the National Agency for Cadastre and Land Registration, is regulated by Government Decision No 1210/2004 of 29 July 2004. The Decision defines ANCPI as a public institution, with legal personality. It is the single authority in the area of cadastre, geodesy, topography, photogrammetry and mapping, and subordinated to the Ministry of Administration and the Interior. In 2005, the emergency governmental ordinance No. 95/2005 laid the responsibility for the establishment of the national environmental spatial infrastructure for policy making with the national central public authority responsible for environmental management. In 2010, the INSPIRE directive was implemented by Government Ordinance nr. 4/2010 establishing the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (INIS). Through this order the coordinating body for INIS is established, i.e. the INIS Council (CINIS). In one of the annexes (4) the responsibles for the coordinating and collaborating public bodies of the INIS Council are listed. Government Ordinance nr 4/2010 also defines the roles and tasks of each of the participating bodies.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


In Romania, the PPP model is gaining importance in the form that ANCPI is the public body with overall responsibility and the private firms perform the bulk of the surveying/map production under contract (Geolink Consulting, Ltd, Romania: National Spatial Data Infrastructure and INSPIRE).


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The “Act on the Free Access to the Information of Public Interest” of 12 October 2001 allows individuals to request public information held by government departments and requires government departments to respond to requests and provide information about their activities within 30 days. Governmental Decision no. 878/2005 on public access to environmental information implements EU Directive 2003/4/EC (<http://www.apador.org/en/legi/hot_1115_2002_e.rtf>). Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information was transposed by the Law of 25 April 2007 (<http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/docs/laws/romania/law_april_2007.pdf>


).


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


In 1996 Romania adopted a modern Copyright Law that went into force on 24 June 1996 (Law no. 8 of 14 March 1996). It explicitly protects three-dimensional works, maps and drawings in the field of topography, geography and science in general. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Romania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 14 Article 9 of the Copyright Act states that official texts of a political, legislative, administrative or judicial nature, and official translations thereof, do not benefit from the legal protection accorded to copyright. Article 122 of the Copyright Act was amended to implement, directive 96/9 on database protection, as part of the effort to bring the Romanian legislation in line with the acquis communautaire.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Art. 26 of the 1991 Constitution states:"" §(1) The public authorities shall respect and protect the intimate, family, and private life. §(2) Any natural person has the right to freely dispose of information on himself unless by this he causes an infringement upon the rights and freedoms of others, on public order, or morals."" Romania implemented directive 95/46 and enacted on 21 November 2001 Law no. 677 regarding the data protection (Data Protection Act) (OJ, Part I, no. 790 of 12 December 2001); and in 2005 Law no. 102/2005 regarding the setting up, organisation and functioning of the National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing.

The legal framework on GI in Slovakia is determined by a number of different laws and decrees. The most important Acts include 


1. Act No. 162/1995 on the Real Estate Cadastre and the Entries of Ownership and Other Rights to the Real Estates (The Cadastre Act) as amended by the Act No. 222/1996 Coll., the Act No. 255/2001 Coll., the Act No. 419/2002 Coll. and the Act No. 173/2004 Coll.


 2. Act No. 215/1995 on Geodesy and Cartography as amended by the Act No. 423/2003 Coll and the Act 346/2007. In this Act, the Primary Database for Geographic Information System is considered to be the core geo-referenced data set for building the State Information System by the public authorities. In this legislation the following issues are dealt with: maintenance, liability, funding and the obligations imposed on users and producers. By the amendment of 2003, an institutional framework that brings together the government, the government institutions and the local administrations, was starting to be developed. In 2007, the Act was amended to implement the requirements of the PSI directive.


 3. Decree of GCCA No. 79/1996 by which the Act No. 162/1995 on the Real Estate Cadastre and the Entries of Ownership and Other Rights to the Real Estates (The Cadastre Act) is executed as amended the Decree No. 72/1997 Coll. , the Decree No. 533/2001 Coll. and the Decree No. 467/2004 Coll.


 4. Decree of GCCA 178/1996 by which the Act of the National Council of the Slovak Republic on Geodesy and Cartography is executed 


5. Act No. 275/2006 on Information Systems of Public Administration.


 6. The Act No. 205/2004 on collecting and disseminating environmental information and on amendment and supplementation of certain acts. 


7. Act No. 3/2010 transposing the INSPIRE directive. The responsibility for the transposition was assigned to the Ministry of Environment by Decision 845/2007 of the Slovak government from 3 October 2007


 8. Government decree of the Slovak Republic No. 540/2002 establishing the Cadastral Portal, which enables authorized access to land registry data via the Internet. The INSPIRE Directive has been transposed into Slovak law by Act No 3/2010 on the National Infrastructure for Spatial Information (the NISI Act – NIPI in Slovak), which entered into force on 1 February 2010. The INSPIRE technical implementing rules are EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Slovak Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 directly applicable. Act No 215/1995 on geodesy and cartography, as amended, which is implemented by Decree of the Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre Authority of the Slovak Republic No 300/2009 defines standards like the parameters of binding coordinate systems and localisation standards for maps.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


PPPs are quite common practice in the Slovak Republic, especially in the sectors of building industry, architecture and others. In the GI-sector the PPPs are considered to be very useful in the development of an SDI. In the Slovak Republic PPP has mainly been applied in the next areas:


 all geodetic surveys for a creation of survey sketches for the GCCA purposes,


 Land Title Consolidation (ROEP) for the GCCA purposes,


 Land Consolidation Project for the GCCA purposes and realization of the


Land Consolidation for the purposes of the Ministry of Agriculture SR,


 aerial photos for the purposes of the Ministry of Agriculture SR – system IACS A number of private companies have formed the Slovak Association for Geoinformatics (SAGI), of which the mission is to support the use and development of geographic information in Slovak Republic, including geographic information systems, remote sensing and related fields. **Policy and legislation on access to public sector information (PSI)**


The right of access to PSI is implemented by the NC SR Act No. 211/2000 on the Free Access to Information of 2000, entering into force in January 2001. It sets broad rules on disclosure of information held by the public organisation. Together with the Act, a Decree of the Ministry of Finance on Calculation Costs related to the providing of Free Access to Public Information has been implemented (ePSIplus National Report Slovakia. This freedom of information legislation relates to the GI sector in general but it does not relate to the GI datasets and to the data from the Cadastre of the Real Estates, which cannot be obtained on the basis of the Free Access to Information law. The transposition of directive 2003/98/EC on re-use of PSI was transposed by an amendment of this Act in August 2005, and by an amendment to the Act on Geodesy and Cartography. Since September 2007 the Cadastral Information provides free information on Land Information System. Registered users are entitled to search the cadastre data over the whole territory of SK, on the basis of full registration and agreement concluded with the operator. Full registration is intended for authorized users such as state organs, bodies active in criminal proceedings, executors, notaries, tax offices etc., which prove a legitimate interest based on the provisions of the body of laws of the Slovak Republic.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Slovak Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 Non-registered users have the right to search the cadastre data in the extent of one cadastral district.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Currently the Slovak Copyright Act is fully in line with the EU legislation. The Slovak Copyright Act (the NC SR Act No. 618/2003) based on the European Commission Database Directive 96/9/EC and Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright in the information society was implemented into Slovak legislation. Works of cartography in analogue or any other form are explicitly protected. The strategy for the SDI does not contain specific copyright provisions. The Act on the Slovak Copyright, the Act on the Budgetary Regulation, the Act on the State Information System, and the Act on the Administrative Charges are applied in this case. Most of the GI is accessible on the basis of a written contract. In the case of information supply via the Internet, a click-use license is considered to be a valid agreement. Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy Since the year 1998 the legal protection of privacy has been enacted in the SR legal framework (the NC SR Act No. 52/1998). The Act on the Protection of Personal Data was approved in July 2002 (the NC SR Act No. 428/2002). It limits the conditions of the collection, disclosure and use of the personal information by government agencies and private enterprises either in electronic or analogue form. It specifies the duties of access, the accuracy and the correction, security, and confidentiality on the data processor. The Act also created an Office for Personal Data Protection to supervise and enforce the Act. The legal protection of privacy is incorporated into the Act on the Real Estate Cadastre and Entries for Ownership and Other Rights to the Real Estates and in the Act on Geodesy and Cartography. The specific provisions in relation to privacy contain forbiddance to publish the personal identification numbers on-line. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into national legislation (the Act No. 610/2003).


**Licensing framework**


Measures for sharing spatial data and services can be defined as legislative, conceptual, and coordinating measures. Legislative measures:- the transposition of the INSPIRE Directive into the NISI Act Before the NISI Act came into force, data sharing was organised by means of agreements between institutions e.g. agreement between the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Slovak Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 Defence, agreement between the MoEnv SR and the Ministry of Defence, agreement between the MoEnv SR and the Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre Authority. 


Conceptual:


- approval of the National eGovernment Concept and the Concept for the Development of Information Systems for the MoEnv SR and other Ministries


- the Government Policy Statement in support of interoperability


- the preparation of special generally binding legislation – an implementing decree for the NISI Act


Coordinating measures:


- the establishment of the NISI Coordination Board – the coordination of the activities of responsible authorities


- the coordination of the work of working parties


For access to the Cadastral Portal, a difference is made between registered and nonregistered users. The former can use data from the entire territory of the country, based on an agreement. Such use is intended for users such as state organs, bodies active in criminal proceedings, executors, notaries, tax offices etc. The latter users do not have to conclude an agreement, but can only search in the extent of one cadastral district (see<https://www.katasterportal.sk/kapor/faq.do>). This is in line with the policy of the Ministry of the Environment that environmentally oriented data created with state funds should be available without restrictions, upon registration and acceptance of copyright terms (Martin Tuchyna, Establishment of spatial data infrastructure within the environmental sector in Slovak Republic, 2006)"					Wednesday, June 15, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Before the INSPIRE directive, Latvia had already been working on the establishment of a legal framework for geographic information for a couple of years. However, before the adoption of the law implementing the INSPIRE directive, an earlier draft Law on Geospatial Information was attempted, but this was never adopted because no final agreement could be reached between the organizations involved. The Law on the State Land Service was adopted in 1992, and adapted by the Cabinet of Ministers Order No.674 “On Reorganisation of the State Land Service” of October 18, 2005. As a result, the geodesy and cartography function was taken over by the Latvia GeoInformatic Agency (LGIA), and the surveying work was delegated to a new public limited company – Latvian State Surveyor. Currently, the operation of the SLS is regulated by the regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 439 “Regulations on the State Land Service” of May 30, 2006. SLS has many agreements on data exchange with several public institutions, such as the Ministry of the Interior, the State Forest Service, the Construction, Energy, and Housing State Agency, the Register of Enterprises, the Central Statistical Bureau, the Centre of Emergency and Disaster Medicine, the Electronic Communication Office, the State Education Development Agency and the Environment, Geology and Meteorology Agency, the Population Register of the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs, the state agency “Latvian Geospatial Information Agency” and the State Inspection for Heritage Protection. Agreements also exist with more than 400 local governments. 


On December 1, 2005, the Parliament reviewed in the final reading and adopted the Law on the State Cadastre of Real Properties as proposed by the experts of the SLS, thus completing the process of more than ten years of drafting a law that would ensure the coordinated administrative, organisational and technical functioning of the State Cadastre of Real Properties and would enable obtaining, registration, maintenance and use of updated textual and spatial data. Pursuant to the Law on State Administration, the state and local government institutions may cooperate both on a specific occasion or permanent bases signing interdepartmental agreements or cooperation agreements. This cooperation model is applied also to ensure permanent cooperation for shared use of geospatial information. Thus, for instance, Latvian Geographic Information Agency has signed an interdepartmental agreement with State Land Survey on the exchange of geographic information, the Ministry of Defence has signed an interdepartmental agreement with the Ministry of Interior for regular delivery of geographic information to bodies reporting to the Ministry of Interior, the Latvian Geographic Information Agency has signed a cooperation agreement with the Rural Support Service for delivering up-to-date geographic information enabling a unified administration of Single Area Payments, and the State Land Survey has signed separate interdepartmental agreements with other government institutions enabling the data provision from the National real estate cadastral information system. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Latvia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 The Ministry of Defence is involved in developing the Cabinet Regulations on the mandatory content of regulations governing the use of geographic data sets and procedures for obtaining a permit. These Cabinet Regulations intend to introduce the use of  licences enabling government or local authorities to perform all activities related to geographic data necessary for performing their tasks and functions and to simplify and fasten the permits delivery. These Regulations are binding on government as well as local authorities and enterprises designated as holders of geographic data sets and promote the shared use of these resources. The Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government Affairs has prepared Regulations regarding the national geoportal (not approved as yet) which will be used as the basis for organising the cooperation between the administrator of the geoportal and holders of the geographic data sets in order to ensure the availability of these data sets and metadata at the geoportal. 


A true legal framework for the NSDI was established by the Law on Geospatial Information, which transposes the INSPIRE directive, was published on 30 December 2009 in the Official Journal and entered into force on 13 January 2010. The law is broader than INSPIRE and is considered as the national law for geodesy, cartography and geospatial information. This law has completely transposed the provisions of the INSPIRE directive and established basic principles for obtaining, maintaining and using geographic information, specifying, for instance, provisions for mandatory storage of metadata for spatial data sets, standard regulations for the use of spatial data sets indicating the most significant national geospatial reference data, etc. The law contains numerous delegations to cabinet regulations that are necessary to ensure that the implementation of the national spatial data infrastructure is technically successful. The majority of these regulations are to be complete by 2011.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There is a cooperation between public and private organizations. For instance, it was intended to create the national geoportal in cooperation with the private sector which should be operational in 2012.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


The law on Freedom of Information was adopted by the Saiema (Parliament) in October 1998 and signed by the State President in November 1998. It guarantees public access to all information in “any technically feasible form” not specifically restricted by law. Information can only be withheld if specifically provided by a statute; e.g. information for internal use of an institution; commercial secrets; information about the private life of an individual, certification, examination, project, tender and similar evaluation procedures. Individuals may use it to obtain their own records. Latvia has transposed both Directive 2003/4 on the access to environmental information and Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI. The transposition of the PSI directive was done by an  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Latvia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 amendment of the Freedom of Information Act, which entered into force in October 2006. This act was complemented by Cabinet Regulation No. 940 “Regulation on the Charged Services of Information Provision”, and Cabinet Regulation No. 338 “The Procedure of Granting an Exclusive Right to Reuse of Information and Publication of Information on Granting of Such Right”.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Latvian Government has joined the Bern Convention and signed the TRIPS Agreement in 1998. Major intellectual property protection legislation is in effect since 1993. A new copyright act dates from 2000 and is in force since 2002. The current law corresponds with WIPO Copyright, TRIPS, and the European directive on the legal protection of databases. The Directive of 2001 regarding copyright in the information society was implemented into the Latvian Copyright Act by the Statutory Instrument No. 16 of 2004 [European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights)] Regulations 2004. The law is in force since 22 April 2004. The term of copyright protection is seventy years after the author’s death, while database protection is granted for fifteen years after the database is formed. Geographical maps, plans, sketches, and moulded works which relate to geography, topography and other sciences, are explicitly mentioned as protected works. During the transposition of the INSPIRE directive, the intellectual property rights on geographic data and the related exceptions were considered to be most problematic. With the help of the Ministry of Culture, a solution was found, and the intellectual property rights of geographic data owners will be governed according to the Copyright law. 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Article 96 of the Latvian Constitution explicitly recognizes the right to privacy by stating that everyone has the inviolable right to private life, home and correspondence. Article 17 of the Constitutional Law on Rights and Obligations of a Citizen and a Person secures the privacy of communications subject only to a judge’s order. A law on data protection was adopted by the Parliament on 23 March 2000. It is based on the EU directive on the processing of personal data and the Council of Europe Convention nr. 108. Latvia has implemented Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications with a framework of regulations. Latvia is a member of the Council of Europe and signed the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data on 11 February 2000. It has signed and ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.


**Licensing framework**


The general rules for data sharing in the Law on Geospatial information have not been developed into licensing policies yet. During 2010, rules of the Cabinet of Ministers were developed that serve as a background for the development of a common approach to data sharing in Latvia. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Latvia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 Licensing of datasets provided by SLS is based on individual contracts. Data, including cadastral data and the national address registry, is available to any interested person, taking into account privacy requirements. They are distributed on paper and in digital form. Some data are available freely on the website of the SLS, while for larger data sets a subscription agreement has to be arranged with SLS. Other examples of access and licensing policies can be found in the Agriculture Data Centre, the Land Parcel Identification Register, the State Register of Forests, the State Fire and Rescue Service, and Latvian Geographic Information Agency."

Law n.68 of the 2/2/1960 assigns the mandate for the collection of Geographic Information to the five National Mapping Agencies :


 Agenzia del Territorio of the Ministry of Finance (former Cadastral Agency);


 The Navy Hydrographical Institute (IIM);


 The Italian Military Geographical Institute (IGM);


 The Air Force Geo-topographical Information Centre (CIGA);


 The National Technical Services (STN).


The 1996 GIS agreement (Intesa Stato-Region ed Enti Locali per la realizzazione dei Sistemi Informativi Geografici di interesse generale” (Agreement between the State, Regions and Local Authorities for the implementation of Geographic Information Systems of general interest) (amended in 2000) was an important step in the development of the Italian NSDI. The agreement was signed by various Ministries, the Regions and some other Local Authorities with the objective to set-up the Italian NSDI, to increase the availability of geographic data and to stimulate harmonisation by the adoption of specifications. Partners in the agreement included the Ministry of Environment, Land Protection and Sea, Minstry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Treasury, Budget and Economic Planning, Public Works, Health, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Transport and Navigation Regional Affairs, AIPA:the Authority for Information Technology in Public Administration, the National Institute of Statistics; furthermore: the Municipalities (ANCI), Provinces (UPI) and Mountain Communities (UNCEM), Companies for the management of public servies (CISPEL) and the Conference of Presidents of Regions and Autonomous Provinces, The Italian e-Government policy and legislation has also been important for the development of the NSDI. The decree creating the Codex for Digital Administration (“Codice dell’Amministrazione Digitale”) was adopted in 2005 and entered into force on 1 January 2006. It is a general decree on e-Administration with articles specifically referring to GI. As was mentioned before, article 59 establishes the “Comitato per le regole tecniche sui dati territoriali” (Committee for technical specifications on GI) and the “Repertorio Nazionale dei Dati Territoriali” (National GI Repository). 


Next to its technical tasks, the Committee should also create rules on the sharing of spatial data at the national and the sub-national level. In 2007, the Committee and the Agenzia del Territorio (the new Cadastral Agency) created technical and economic rules for the sharing of cadastral data between public bodies, compliant with article 59 of the Codex.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Italy K.U.Leuven (SADL) 24 The INSPIRE Directive was translated into national law by Decreto Legislativo 27.01.2010 n. 32; main objectives: public access to data and services, construction of an efficient SDI and re-use of data. The Ministry of Environment, Land Protection and Sea is appointed as the responsible authority for the implementation and is supported by the The Institute for Environmental Protection and Research.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The CTC manages to interact with private sector companies working in the data production sector. This is especially true for data production at regional and municipal level. At these levels, data production has traditionally been carried out by private companies under technical coordination of the public authorities.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


There is a general law for cost-free access to PSI (Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990) that provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest. The specific conditions for access are regulated by the ministry involved. Regional law mentioned in document (“Disciplina generale sulla tutela e l'uso del territorio (L.R. 20, 24 marzo 2000)”) states´Every participant of the Planning Conference for the Regional/Urban planning must share their data with rules compliant to “Atto di indirizzo e coordinamento tecnico per l'attuazione della L.R. 20 (Direttiva A-27)”” Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been transposed into Italian legislation by Decreto Legislativo 19 agosto 2005, n. 195, ""Attuazione della direttiva  003/4/CE sull'accesso del pubblico all'informazione ambientale"". Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI has been implemented by the Act of 24 January 2006, n. 36, ""Attuazione della direttiva 2003/98/ce relativa al riutilizzo di documenti nel settore pubblico"". The Codex for Digital Administration (Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale), previously mentioned, was then updated to be consistent with the implementation of the PSI Directive. 


The Codex foresees, in a generalized way, that any data managed by a public administration, with limited exceptions and whilst respecting personal data protection rules and for reasons of public security and national defense , can be accessed and re-used by any other public administration for the execution of their tasks, and this without any costs (excepted if ""exceptional costs"" may occur). However, Article 9, paragraph 8 states that data ""may"" be in a form preventing their re-use for commercial purposes. Paragraph 8 foresees the possibility of derogating from the free data and services offered and ensures that public authorities may, for reasons of self-funding, ensure access on payment of fees from users. Art. 10 states guaranteed free access, exchange and then re-use of environmental data and related services between public authorities , without new or increased burden on public finances, precluding any limitation and obstacle to let this happen. For spatial data sets  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Italy K.U.Leuven (SADL) 25 already acquired, the date of entry into force of the decrete, under conditions of license, public authorities are authorized to provide data sets and services provided for the second license. 


Even here, however, it is possible to derogate from the gratuity and, through appropriate orders to be issued, public authorities can be authorized to levy charges for the provision of spatial data to other public authorities. The European Commission made a complaint against Italy by a letter of formal notice for not transposing the directive correctly. Early 2010, the Italian authorities announced changes to the law, in order to make it compliant with the directive. The law is currently under consideration by the Parliament. The decree of the Director of the “Agenzia del Territorio” : decree November 13th, 2007 is available on the website of DigitPA at URL <http://www.digitpa.gov.it/sites/default/files/normativa/Decreto%2013_11_2007.pdf>


states that the cadastral database, including administrative, cadastral, graphic and map information related to all cadastral parcels, are made available to Public Administrations. The decree defines the way Public Administrations can use cadastral data in accordance with the laws on privacy and on the re-use of data and cadastral information. Access to cadastral data is free of charge, except for exceptional costs if any related to the implementation and supply of special services related to special needs.

The Italian Copyright Act of 1941 has been amended several times throughout the years. The Database Directive 96/9/EC was implemented into Italian law by Decree no. 169 of 6 May 1999. Legislative Decree No. 68 of 9 April 2003 has implemented Community Directive No. 2001/29 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. The Decree came into force on 29 April 2003. No copyright exists in the texts of official acts of the state or public administrations (e.g. laws and judicial decisions). The State and local government can however be copyright owners of works created and published under their name, account and at their expense. But it only enjoys a 20-year period of protection on its own creations. The state may of course renounce the right to royalties if it wishes to assure maximum public access. Photographs that are original are subject to normal copyright. All other photographs are covered by article 88 of the Copyright Act. The photographer has the exclusive right to reproduce, publish and sell the photographs taken by him or her. The exploitation right on non-original photographs lasts twenty years after production.

The founding law of the Hellenic Mapping and Cadastral Organization (HEMCO) (law no. 1647/1986) deals with the use, dissemination of personal data and general national security issues. Law 3882/2010 FEK 166A on the creation of the National Geospatial Information Infrastructure (EVGEP) is the law that transposes the INSPIRE Directive. The Law was adopted on September 22, 2010 and aims to ensure equal access to geospatial data and services for all citizens and Public Administration. The Law is the answer to the need to: 


a) establish harmonized practices and standards for the collection, production, procurement, management, sharing and distribution of geospatial data and 


 b) comply with Directive 2007/2/EC (INSPIRE), which provides a framework of technical specifications for interoperability to enable the automated sharing of geospatial data in the environment (e.g. areas NATURA 2000) at national and European level.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The Hellenic Mapping and Cadastre Organization was created in 1986 and is the official cartographic agency in Greece operating under the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. One of the responsibilities include the establishment of the National Cadastre system. In July 1994, the HEMCO started with the preparation for the building of the Hellenic Cadastre. For this purpose, a company was created: “Ktimatologio S.A.” , a Legal Entity of Private Law with the mission to study, develop and operate the Hellenic Cadastre. The company was founded with a joint decision of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Minister of Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works (Decision 81706/6085/6-10-1995/Government Gazette 872Β/19-10-1995). Ktimatologio S.A. operates according to the rules of private finance and the provisions of article 5 of Law 2229/1994, of the coded Law 2190/1920, of Law 2308/1995 and Law Ν.2664/1998, as these stand today. Furthermore, the company does not fall under the class of organizations and businesses of the broader state sector; regulations that concern companies directly or indirectly owned by the State do not apply to Ktimatologio S.A. The sole shareholder of the company is the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. However, since there is no private capital involved, it is not considered as a true PPP. Both the HEMCO and Ktimatologio S.A. (Hellenic Cadastre) are members of EuroGeographics.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Greece K.U.Leuven (SADL) 13


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The main laws regulating and facilitating access to the information maintained by the Public Sector are:


1. Law 2690/1999 “Hellenic Code for Administrative Procedure” (especially article 5) which replaced law 1599/1986 “State–Citizen Relations”. It is a new freedom of information act that gives citizens the right of access to the administrative documents created by government agencies.


2. Law 3448/2006 “Reuse of public Sector Information, Local authorities Affairs etc” through which PSI Directive 2003/1998 was transposed into national law.


3. The Common Ministerial Decision No 11764/653 of 17th March 2006 by ajoint Ministerial Decision (Minister of Interior, Public Administration and Decentralization, the Minister of Economy and Finance, the Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change and the Minister of Justice), through which the European Directive 2003/4/EC concerning the access to environmental information was transposed into national law.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights** 


In the past decade Greece has rapidly caught up with the rest of Europe by introducing modernized laws in the area of intellectual property. The Greek Copyright Act (Law no. 2121/1993) was a landmark in the legal history of copyright in Greece. However, the copyright legislation is still considered to be inadequate for the development of an NSDI. This is partly covered by the transposition of the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society. Directive 96/9 of the European Parliament and the Council of 11-3-1996 concerning the Legal Protection of Databases and other Regulations on the legal protection of databases was implemented in Greece by specific legal provisions (art. 7 of Law 2819/2000). Article 2 of the Copyright Act stipulates that the protection afforded under this Law shall not apply to official texts expressive of the authority of the State, notably to legislative,  dministrative or judicial texts. The Hellenic Military Geographical Service has set restrictions to the access to spatial datasets and services due to National Defense for classified areas. Law 3257/2004 “Regulation of the Armed Forces Staff Affairs” and especially article 11, which amended article 13 of the Legislative Decree 1013/1971, refers to the protection of  tellectual property rights of the Hellenic Military Geographical Service in cases of use by the public or private sector of the geographical data produced and maintained by this Service, while an approval by the same Service is required before any production, dissemination or circulation of high resolution (i.e., higher than 1 meter) geographical data or imagery acquired from any source. With regard to the protection of national defense within the EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Greece K.U.Leuven (SADL) 14 HNC, high-level representation of the Ministry of Defense ensures that, for what concerns policy on spatial information sharing arrangements, decisions will not compromise national security. With regard to international relations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has an important role in collaboration with the ministry of Defense. Map production in Greece is considered as work, that is, original intellectual scientific creation related to geography, surveying, architecture and science in general. As work, it is protected by Greek legislation and especially law 2121/1993 “About Intellectual Property and Related Rights”. The Hellenic Military Service is the Greek authority that produces and provides topographic maps in Greece. These maps are used as reference base maps by most public authorities.


However, until 2010, the data sharing arrangements and intellectual property right restrictions for the use and reproduction of these maps posed significant barriers, both economic and practical, with regard to the development and data sharing of spatial information generated from the use of those, such as geological maps. The INSPIRE-Law for the ""National Geospatial Information Infrastructure” mandates the obligatory free sharing of spatial data and services within the public sector as well as to to the public for non-commercial uses. The establishment of the catalogue of existing datasets and services and their metadata within the national geoportal, following the determination of focal points and establishment of datasets owners, provides the necessary technical and governance supportive measures to enable the effective implementation of the law. As a result, the data of the governmental bodies are becoming freely available for the public through geodata.gov.gr (open data) which offers open data on the background of Google maps, open street map and LandInc accordingly their specific simplified and standardized data and license agreements. Other geospatial data are provided using the specific terms of the Greek license Creative Commons Attribution ( CC BY V.3.0) as specified in detail in the relevant license . This means that it is sufficient to indicate the source, i.e. geodata.gov.gr .


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


During the last decade, Greece harmonized its legislation to the one in force in the European Union by introducing modern laws for the protection of intellectual property but also of privacy. More specifically:


1. Law 2472/1997: “Protection of the Individual from the Processing of Personal Data” (<http://www.dpa.gr/legal_eng.htm>) that follows the provisions of European Directive 95/46/EC concerning the protection of personal data.


2. Law 2915/2001 and especially article 34: “Amendment of Law 2472/1997 – Protection of the Individual from the Processing of Personal Data”


3. Law 3057/2002 and especially article 81: “Harmonization with Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 29-5-2001 for the Harmonization of Certain Aspects of the Creator and of Related Rights to the Information Society and other Regulations”.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Greece K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15


4. The Presidential Decree No 131/2003: “Adaptation to Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and the Council concerning Certain Legal Aspects of the Information Society Services, especially Electronic Commerce, in the Internal Market”.


5. Law 3471/2006: “Protection of Personal Data and of Private Life in the Electronic Communications Sector and Amendments to Law 2472/1997” through which Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 12-7-2002 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into Greek law.


**Licensing framework**


Until the new law ‘National Infrastructure for Geospatial Information”, a clear and harmonized licensing national policy concerning spatial datasets and services, either among public authorities or for public access did not exist. Law 3882/20107  creates the National Geospatial Information Infrastructure which includes the establishment of general principles , rules, measures and procedures in administrative, legal and technological level for the organization of uniform management practices, availability and sharing of geospatial information."

The 2008 Law for Real Estate Cadastre (Official Gazette of the FYR Macedonia #40/08) contains a number of provisions on the FYR Macedonian NSDI. The NSDI is defined as “a set of activities that enable quality collection, administration, sharing and use of georeferenced spatial data” (article 2). Under the Law, AREC is required to prepare a strategic plan of the NSDI for a period of 5 years and an annual programme for implementing the strategic plan. The plan has to be adopted by the government of the FYR Macedonia, and the annual programme has to be EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 FYROM K.U.Leuven (SADL) 9 endorsed. Both documents have to determine the type and the scope of the activities and the resources necessary for implementing these activities (article 4).

**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


Article 16 of the FYR Macedonian constitution guarantees the freedom of access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information. The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Character was adopted on 25 January 2006 and is applicable from September 2006. Under the law, any natural or legal person has the right to obtain information from public authorities by filing a request. The request can be oral, in writing or by electronic means (see<http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/31/topic/3>). The Regulation for the manner and procedure of exercising the right to a free access to public information (no. 01-3563/1, date 27.03.2007) regulates the access to information from the cadastre (see<http://www.katastar.gov.mk/en/Page.aspx?Id=216&m=1490>).


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Article 47 of the Constitution guarantees the rights that stem from scientific, artistic or other intellectual works. The Law on Copyright and Related Rights dates from 1996 and has been amended to harmonise it with the European legislation on copyright and related rights, including the 1996 database directive.In 2009, preparations started for a new draft legislation on copyright (Ministry of Economy, Strategy for Intellectual Property of the FYR Macedonia 2009-2012). The law protects individual and intellectual creations in the field of literature, science, arts and the domains of creation, regardless of the type, manner and form of expression. Explicit mention is made of photographic works and cartographic works, plans, sketches, technical drawings, projects, tables, plastic works and other works of identical or similar character in domain of geography, topography, architecture or other scientific, educational, technical or artistic nature (article 12). Official texts from the legislative, executive or judicial sphere and their translations, when published as an official text, are not protected (article 16). 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Article 18 of the Constitution of the FYR Macedonia guarantees the security and confidentiality of personal information and the protection of citizens from any violation of their personal integrity deriving from the registration of personal information through data processing. The Law on the Protection of Personal Data was adopted in 1994 and amended in 2002 to implement some of the provisions of directive 95/46/EC on the processing of personal data. Based on recommendations from the European Community, a new law was adopted in January 2005 (Official Gazette of the FYR Macedonia # 07/05, see

Next to the strategic documents for the NGII programme, which were adopted by the state administrative bodies, regional and local governments, and professional unions and the private sector, the following legal instruments should be mentioned. First, Law 183/2006 Sb. on landscape planning and building regulations – in force since 1 January 2007 – imposes the development and updating of “spatial analytical data records”, which have the character of spatial data derived from primary sources and expected (even though it is not explicitly required in the law) to be available in digital form. Next, the amendment of the State Statistical Act (act no. 89/1995 Sb o státní statistické službě) in 2006 imposed the development of system of statistical registers including a territorial Register of census districts and buildings. The INSPIRE directive was transposed by an amendment of Act No. 123/1998 Coll. On the Right of Access to Environmental Information (Aarhus Convention) and entered into force in November 2009. The executive regulation is currently in preparation. At the same time the Act on the Right of Access to Environmental Information was amended, Act No. 200/1994 Coll. On surveying was also changed.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There is no tradition of PPP’s. Nevertheless their usefulness and necessity are now considered to be obvious. Good examples can be found in several areas, e.g. in the cooperation and functioning of CAGI and Nemoforum. Concrete examples of broader importance are e.g. the cooperation between public and private institutions and organizations in the production of the information system of the cadastre and real estates or the cooperation between the Czech Ministry of Informatics and the Czech Association for Geoinformation.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


In general terms, access to information is regulated by the law on free access to information on public administration activities and actions (Act no. 106/1999), which entered into force in January 2000. The Act gives citizens the right to ask for any information connected with the functioning and dealing of the state administrative bodies, local self-governing authorities and certain other official institutions. Act 106/1999 is based on the Freedom of Access to Environmental Information Act (123/1998 Sb.). This act regulates the compulsory availability to the public of a range of information and adopts the Aarhus Convention and Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information. Act 106/1999 also implements the PSI directive, by an amendment of 2006. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Czech Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 The transposition of INSPIRE has amended the Act on Freedom of Access to Environmental Information, ensuring that citizens do not need any specific application to access the free of charge maps, and imposing technical parameters on the spatial data. Searching data on the Geo-Portal is free of charge, while charges are made for download, analysis and specific actions.

Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights On 1 December 2000 the Copyright Act (Law no. 121/2000 of 7 April 2000 on Copyright, Rights Related to Copyright and on the Amendment of Certain Laws) came into effect. Article 3 of the Copyright Act determines that copyright protection does not apply to an official work, such as legal regulations, decisions, public charters, publicly accessible registers and the collection of their records, and also official drafts of an official work and other preparatory official documentation including the official translation of such work, Chamber of Deputies and Senate publications, memorial chronicles of a municipality (municipal chronicle), state symbols and symbols of a regional self-governing unit, and other such works where there is public interest in their exclusion from copyright protection. On the other hand, the act gives traditionally copyright to cartographic products. A related important copyrighted area is the protection of databases schemas. The Czech Copyright Act of 2000 was discussed in the Parliament in 2005-2006 in order to complete the implementation of the EU Copyright Directive and the EU  nforcement Directive. The amendments were adopted in summer 2006.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The individual’s privacy is safeguarded by article 7(1) of the 1993 Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Article 10 provides the right to human dignity, protection from unauthorized interference in person and family life, and misuse of his or her personal information. Article 13 prohibits the violation of ""letters and other papers and records"" held privately or communicated through the mail or other means. Act no. 101 of 2000 on Personal Data Protection came into force on 1 June 2000. It is based on the EU Data Protection Directive as part of the Czech Republic's efforts towards membership of the EU. The new act creates an Office for Personal Data Protection as an independent supervisory body.

The Republic of Cyprus has ratified the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (“the Aarhus Convention”) by passing Law No.33(III)/2003. Further, the Parliament of Cyprus passed the Law on Public Access to Information Related to the Environment of 2004 - No.119(I)/2004 for the purposes of harmonising its legislation with Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. According to Law No.119(I)/2004, public authorities are obliged to make available environmental information held by or for them to any applicant at his request, and without his having to state or prove an interest. Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information was transposed in November 2006 by Law No 132 (I)/2006. Spatial data maintained by DLS is currently considered as property of DLS and the Government, and is not readily available to the public without official permission. Cadastral and topographical spatial and legal/fiscal information exported from the Land Information System databases are currently distributed in digital form to other Government Departments and semi-government organizations upon their request. Spatial cadastral, topographical, legal and fiscal data can be accessed by officially applying to DLS Director. Citizens do not directly get access to the cadastral data, but they can get a Certificate of registration of Immovable Property. Other geographic data such as aerial photographs and topographical datasets are provided both in raster and vector form to interested persons or organizations.

The Cyprus Law relating to Copyright is set out in the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Law of 1976 to 2006 (Law No. 59/1976, as amended by Laws 63/77, 18(I)/1993, 54(I)/1999, 12(I)/2001, 128(I)2002, 128(I)/2004 and 123(I)/2006). The amendment of 2004 included the 2001 Copyright Directive into Cypriot law. The Copyright Act does not contain any specific protection for maps or geographic data, but it does protect photographs. All works created by or under the direction or control of the Government are explicitly protected by copyright.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Constitution of Cyprus contains the following articles related to privacy in Appendix D, PART II. Article 15 guarantees that ""every person has the right to respect for his private and family life."" Article 16 guarantees that ""every person's dwelling house is inviolable"" and Article 17 guarantees that ""every person has the right to respect for, and to the secrecy of, his correspondence and other communication if such other communication is made through means not prohibited by law"" and ""there shall be no interference with the exercise of this right except in accordance with the law and only in cases of convicted and unconvicted prisoners and business correspondence and communication of bankrupts during the bankruptcy administration."" The protection of personal data is regulated by Law 138(I) of 23 November 2001 on the Protection of Personal Data. It is based on the Data Protection Directive of the EU. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communication was transposed in national law in June 2004, in the Regulation of Electronic Communications and Postal Services Law. The National Land Information System was designed in such a way to provide several security levels and to provide access to several groups of authorized users. Confidential information is kept only for internal DLS use and access is restricted.


**Licensing framework**


Digital spatial geographic data is provided under terms and conditions. A specific set of terms governs the supply of digital cadastral plans, digital topographic information, and digital legal/fiscal records. The user is not allowed to copy, digitize, reproduce or transfer the data without the permission of the director of DLS. He can only use them for his own purposes within the agreement and is not allowed to provide the maps or part of them to any other persons or organizations. For large projects which involve the bulk supply of digital geographic data, separate agreements are signed between the interested parties and the Director of DLS. Standard licences are currently being set up to harmonise the description of conditions for different groups of stakeholders."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


Access to public sector information is organised by the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as it was amended in 2003. This Act regulates access to public sector information with several exclusions. Access to publicly held information is nationally free of charge. However, government departments may charge for the time taken to extract the information requested. Under this act, anyone is entitled to apply for access to records not otherwise publicly available. Requests have to comply with a number of formalities. They have to be in writing, although e-mails are also acceptable. If information is desired in a particular form, this should be mentioned in the application. Applications should be as detailed as possible to ensure that the staff of the Department where access is requested, is in a position to identify the records being sought. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations, S.I.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Ireland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 133 of 2007. Directive 2003/98 on re-use of PSI was transposed by Statutory Instrument no. 279 of 2005, “European Communities (Re-use of Public Sector Information) Regulations 2005”. Under these regulations, there is no obligation for the public sector bodies to make their information available. If they decide to do so, they have to follow the Regulations.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Irish Copyright Act of 1963 was replaced by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. It protects works that are original and expressed in a certain form. Copyright protection expires 70 years after the death of the author. No specific measures are taken concerning the protection of geographic or photographic works. The Government can also be a copyright holder, but its copyright expires fifty years after the work was made. The Directive on the legal protection of databases was incorporated in the Copyright Act 2000. It also implemented the main terms of the then draft Directive 2001/29 on the Harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society. On 19th January 2004 Ireland transposed Directive 2001/29 into Irish law by the law enacting the European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2004. 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Irish Government adopted the Data Protection Act in 1998 in order to transpose the European Directive on data protection of 1995 into national legislation. The Act addresses personal data in the area of information gathering, retention and use of collected personal information. It states that computer users must observe the data protection principles when using a computerised file containing personal information. Data held in hard copy is not covered by the Act. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into Irish law on 6 November 2003. Next to the Data Protection Act, the Freedom of Information Act also provides for a number of protective measures for certain categories of information. Exemptions are made to the general rule of access to records of public authorities that are not publicly available. These exemptions include personal information, information obtained in confidence, and commercially sensitive information. The Land Registry has its own policy on privacy. Its documents can only be consulted by the registered owner of the property, any person authorized by the registered owner and a limited number of other persons authorized by the Land Registration Rules 1972. A request can also be made under the Freedom of Information Act, but when it concerns a record holding personal information, the request will only be granted with the consent of the subject.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Ireland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16


**Licensing framework**


According to the PSI Regulations, a public sector body may allow for re-use of documents without conditions or may impose conditions, where appropriate through a license, dealing with relevant issues. Such conditions cannot unnecessarily restrict possibilities for re-use and cannot be used to restrict competition. Any applicable conditions for the re-use of documents have to be non-discriminatory for comparable categories of re-use. The Minister has to ensure that standard licenses for the re-use of documents, which can be adapted to meet particular license applications, are available in digital format and can be processed electronically. There is no unified licensing framework. The geo-data providers have their own licensing policies. Ordnance Survey Ireland provides data to public customers via outlets throughout the country, through and agent network and via online ordering. For reproducing maps in publications such as books, flyers, academic publications, etc., an application form has to be filled out. Terms and conditions and a price list can be found on the website (<http://www.osi.ie/en/alist/copyright.aspx>). Separate annual licences are available for architects, engineers and surveyors, for auctioneers, estate agents and valuers, and for solicitors and legal firms. Finally, a separate licence is available for Internet use. For business and industry use of data sets (including government), distinctions are made between annual licences and project licences. Specific conditions apply to academic and research use (<http://www.osi.ie/en/alist/digital_licence.aspx>).The Irish Geological Survey moved towards making its data freely available for any type of use in 2009. The data is delivered in a zip-file together with a data licence agreement. The data is for exclusive use of the user and cannot be passed on. The source of the data must be acknowledged and where data are used in manipulated or value-added form as a commercial product, a royalty may be owned."

In May 2011, the Act on the Infrastructure for Digital Spatial Data was adopted. The law stipulates what has to be implemented (data, metadata and services) and how this has to be organised (role LMI, coordinating structure, elaboration of an implementation plan, etc.). This legislation is based on a decision of the EEA countries to implement the INSPIRE Directive (Agreement on the European Economic Area, as amended by the EEA Joint Committee No. 55/2010 from 30 April 2010). The act also stipulates the changes to existing legislation. More in particular to Article 4 of Act no. 103/2006, on land surveying and basic mapping (see further). The activities and responsibilities of the National Land Survey of Iceland were laid down in a law of 1997 (Law no. 95/1997), with subsequent amendments in December 1998 and December 2000). The law covers the field of surveying and mapmaking, including provisions for the control of the Ministry of Environment and the purpose of the LMI as a governmental institution. A new law on land surveying and basic mapping was approved by the Icelandic Parliament on June 3, 2006. This law dealt with the role and tasks of NLSI and stipulated a.o. that NSLI withdraw from its competitive operations and that the institute has to sell its stock of maps and CDs before January 1, 2007. The law states that the tasks of the National Land Survey of Iceland are:


 To advise the Ministry for the Environment in NLSI’s operational fields and as regards policy making in land surveying and official basic mapping.


 The structure and maintenance of reference materials and accessible geodetic reference systems and height reference systems for the whole of Iceland.


 To take the initiative in the making and applying of standards in a geographic information system (GIS).


 To make, maintain and disseminate digital layers on a scale of 1:50.000 and on smaller scales.


 To provide access to data which NLSI keeps in its databases.


 To register and disseminate information about spatial data in Iceland.


 To engage in professional co-operation with universities, institutes, businesses and international organizations in accordance with the tasks of the institute. The Act on the Infrastructure for Digital Spatial Data added following task to this list:


 To oversee execution of the Act on infrastructure for spatial data, incl. taking responsibility for operations, maintenance and technological development of spatial data. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Iceland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The LMI determines on an individual basis whether a project should be handled in-house,


or by a sub-contractor after advertising for bids. As a good example of a successful collaboration, the municipality of Reykjavík, in cooperation with the state telecommunication company, has been developing and running LUKR, the Reykjavík GIS, since 1988.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information**


The Icelandic Freedom of Information Act no. 50 of 1996 applies to state and municipal administration and to the activities of private parties insofar as they have been entrusted with official power to take decisions regarding people's rights or obligations. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been transposed by Act No 23/2006 on the right to environmental information (<http://web.eftasurv.int/details.aspx?memberState=ISL&ecRef=2003/4>). The Freedom of information Act was amended in 2006 to incorporate the provisions of directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information. In 2009, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a working group to review the Act in order to consider the expansion of access to public sector information, and possibly extend the scope of the Act to private bodies that are fully owned by the Icelandic government (see


<http://www.epsiplatform.eu/news/news/iceland_review_information_act>).


**Legal protection of GIS by intellectual property rights**


The Copyright Act no. 73 of 29 May 1972 has been amended by Act no. 78 of 30 May 1984, Act no. 57 of 2 June 1992 and Act no. 145 of 27 December 1996. Act no. 60 of 19 May 2000 inserted article 50, which provides legal protection for databases. The last amendments of the Copyright Act took effect in 2006 (Act on amendments to the Copyright Act No 73/1972 with later amendments, no. 9/2006  <http://web.eftasurv.int/details.aspx?memberState=ISL&ecRef=2001/29>), when the 2001/29/EC directive on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society was transposed. Article 49 of the Copyright Act offers special legal protection to photographs. Article 8 of the law on land surveying and basic mapping stipulates that the State owns all rights acquired by the LMI. The institute protects the interests of the State in the areas of copyrights and utilisation rights regarding all materials that it has acquired, processed or published in connection with the surveying, mapping or photographing of Iceland. In addition, matters concerning copyrights are also contained within copyright bill, no. 73/1972, with later amendments. Article 9 stipulates that the LMI communicates information and provides access to data in its archives. Regarding original material derived from outside the institute, further distribution of such material shall be preceded by an agreement with the original source. It is permitted to grant utilisation rights for all EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Iceland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 information in the areas of surveying and mapping that is stored in the LMI’s archives, under the conditions that the source is credited and that the credibility of the information is not compromised. The new Act on the Infrastructure for Digital Spatial Data does not impact the authorities’ copyrights on spatial data which appertain to the law. Digital spatial data owned by parties others than those explicitly mentioned in the law will be subject to it if the owner of the information has received permission to connect it to the geoportal, cf. Article 5, on the basis of this law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The data protection principles of Directive 95/46/EEC have been implemented into Icelandic law by means of the Data Protection and Handling of Personal Information Act no. 77 of 2000. On 1 January 2000 this Act came into force. Its last amendment dates from 2003 (Act no. 46/2003). Directive 2002/58/EC was transposed by the Electronic Communications Act no. 81 of 25 July 2003 (<http://www.pta.is/upload/files/Electronic%20Communications%20Act%202003.pdf>).


**Licensing framework**


The Information department of the LMI handles operations in the area of disseminating information to the community, the sale of data and the handling of publishing licenses. The publishing of maps, aerial photographs and other materials is allowed upon written permission and the payment of royalty fees. The largest source of income for the LMI in 2008 from the sale of data was the sale of subscriptions to the IS 50V database, with 25 new subscribers. The users can subscribe to the entire database, or select the areas and layers that they need (National Land Survey, Annual Report 2008, Next, aerial photographs can also be purchased, either by downloading the photographs or by buying copies on a CD."

Act LVXXI of 1996 on Surveying and Mapping and the related Ministerial decrees provide the core of the legal background of GIS-related issues. All official surveying, mapping and related activities are governed by this Act. The basic aim of the Act is to ensure that base maps covering the total area of the country are available, as to enable land registration, development of geographic information systems, and a wide range of applications on various economic, scientific and social subjects. The Act makes it compulsory to use the governmental base map data to create GIS.


The Joint Decree No 21/1997 “On execution of some rules defined by the Law LXXVI of 1996 on Activities in Surveying and Mapping” regulates the co-operation between the ministers responsible for surveying and mapping activities and the rules and conditions for the operation of a Map Supply Coordination Committee. Resolution No. 13 from 1997 of the Governmental Commission on Informatics and Telecommunications provides further steps toward the set up of an NSDI. Recently, new legislation has been added that is also of importance for the legal framework for the Hungarian SDI. The amendment of the Environmental Law of December 2008 entered into force on 15 May 2009, and Government decree 241/2009.X.29 setting up the National Environmental Spatial Information System is ready to be officially adopted, including the implementation of the INSPIRE directive. Next to this decree, Government decision 1176/2009 (X. 26) setting up and clarifying tasks of the committee supporting the work of the INSPIRE contact point is also ready to enter into force. The remaining rules of the directive that needed to be transposed are included in a new governmental decree 241/2009.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Private commercial firms are indirectly involved in helping to implement the NSDS as subcontractor e.g. in the implementation of the National Cadastral Program in a competitive environment. For the surveying and mapping, there is a partnership supported by the Chamber of Engineers, the Hungarian Society of Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, the HUNGIS Foundation, etc.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Hungary K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 There are particular efforts to strengthen PPP under the EU-ESA-initiative on GMES through collaboration between HUNAGI-FÖMI-HSO-EUSC.


**Policy and legislation on access to and reuse of public sector information (PSI)**


The Constitution of Hungary states that “in the Republic of Hungary everyone has the right to know and to disseminate data of public interest”. This fundamental right was elaborated in the Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Accessibility of Public Data, which requires all government agencies at national or local level to facilitate access to information in their possession, and to make accessible data concerning their activities, data types held by them, and acts concerning their operation. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has partially been transposed (see <http://ec.europa.eu/environment/impel/pdf/enforcementnoteaccess.pdf>). Act LIII of 1995 was amended to specify that environmental data must be accessible for everyone (except sensitive data). Directive 2003/98 on re-use of PSI been fully transposed through the amended Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Accessibility of Public Data; the Act on Publication of Data of Public Interest; and the 2005 Act on Freedom of Information by Electronic Means.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The most important rule of the Hungarian copyright-related legislation is the Law LXXVI of 1999 on Copyright, which was modified during the past decade several times. It explicitly protects photographs and maps and cartographic works. In 2000, the decision was taken by the Government in the Law Approximation Program to revise the copyright and related laws in order to ensure the harmonization with the copyright directives of the European Union, and to meet the requirement needed for the Hungarian adoption of the Copyright Agreement in the institutional framework of the WIPO. The sui generis right was included in the Copyright Act in 2001. Directive 2001/29 on copyright in the information society was also transposed into Hungarian law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Article 59 of the Hungarian Constitution protects the individual’s right to the ""good standing of his reputation"" as well as the inviolability of his or her home, private affairs and personal data. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 ungary K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 Furthermore, the protection of personal data is assured by Act LXIII of 1992 on protection of personal data and the disclosure of data of public interest. The purpose of this Act is to guarantee the right of everyone to exercise control over his or her personal data and to have access to data of public interest, except as otherwise provided by law under this Act. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information plays the same role concerning the protection of personal data as he does for the access to public sector documents. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into national law."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The main legal instruments specifically relating to GI include:ƒ Decree no. 2004-1246 of 22 November 2004 on the National Geographic Institute, consolidated in May 2005; ƒ Decision of 16 March 2005 stating the list of geographic data sets and cartography that has to be maintained by IGN as part of its public task;ƒ Decision of 19 April on the development and maintenance of the RGE;ƒ Decree on the role and the composition of the CNIG, onsolidated on 30 September 1999.


After the Ministry of Public Works had created a first draft for the transposition of the INSPIRE directive in 2007, the responsibility for the transposition was shifted to the Ministry of Environment, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea. During 2008 and 2009, a draft proposal was eveloped, but at the end of 2009, it was decided to transpose the directive by an Ordonnance. The law that allows this was submitted to the Senate in December 2009 (see


<http://www.ign.fr/institut/documentArticle.do?idDoc=5653965&indexRoot=3&indexChild=1>）


 


With this law, the Parliament agrees with legislation that is still to come, so that it  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 does not have to debate about the law when it is presented. This law is currently in the Chamber, but the Parliament has a backlog, so there is some delay. A text of the transposition law is ready, with a minimal transposition of the directive. Executive measures are necessary in order to fully transpose the directive. These will be ready by the end of the year (see <http://inspire.ign.fr/index.php/actualites-inspire>).


IGN performs its tasks on the basis of a contract with the government. This contract sets the objectives for a certain period, generally a couple of years. A new agreement was made in 2008 between IGN and the Ministry of Food Supply, Agriculture and Fisheries (MAAP) and the Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Seas (MEEDDM). In addition, the white paper on defence and national security published on July 31, 2008 planned a closer cooperation with the Ministry of Defence (see IGN, 2008 Activity report). Since 2010, an agreement on targets and performance between IGN and the government specifies the objectives for the period 2010-2013.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There is no true PPP in France. For instance, geometric experts having tasks relating to the cadastre are considered to have a public mission, so they cannot be considered as private partners in relationship to the state. The private sector is involved in the creation of value-added products, but rather as a client of the public sector data providers than as a partner. Currently, the private sector does not play a big role in the NSDI in France, but there are signs that its role will grow in the future.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


Law no. 78-753 of 17 July 1978 (‘Loi portant diverses mesures d'amélioration des relations entre l'administration et le public et diverses dispositions d'ordre administratif, social et fiscal’) regulates the freedom of access to administrative documents. This “CADA” law has been amended several times throughout the years. The law applies to central government, local government and the administrations of public undertakings. Requests may be refused on a limited number of grounds, such as state security, privacy and commercial secrets. Documents received may not be reproduced or redistributed for commercial purposes. Jurisprudence of this law allows the charging for data access. Directive 2003/98 on re-use of PSI was transposed by Ordonnance n° 2005-650 relative à la liberté d'accès aux documents administratifs et à la réutilisation des informations publiques of 6 June 2005 and by the Décret 2005-1755 relatif à la liberté d'accès aux documents administratifs et à la réutilisation des informations publiques, pris pour l'application de la loi n° 78-753 du 17 juillet 1978. The former contains a general right of re-use of all the information in the documents held by the administrations mentioned in the law of 1978. Directive 2003/4 was transposed into French law by the Law of 26  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 October 2005 (LOI no 2005-1319 du 26 octobre 2005 portant diverses dispositions d’adaptation au droit communautaire dans le domaine de l’environnement, <http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=DEVX0500055L>


 


The Agence du Patrimoine Immatériel d’Etat was established in 2007, under the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Budget, with among others the responsibility to help economic operators to access PSI for re-use and to create awareness with the public bodies with regard to the possibilities for re-use. For this, it has created model licences; it supports public bodies in developing their registers of information and has proposed to create a portal for access to all re-usable public sector information. APIE works closely with the Commission d’accès aux documents administratifs (CADA), and maintains contacts with the Groupement Français de l’Industrie de l’Information (GFII) and the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING) (see


<https://www.apiefrance.com/sections/acces_thematique/reutilisation-des-informationspubliques/la_reutilisation_des/>


 


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Intellectual Property Code of 1957 (revised several times throughout the years) includes a section on copyright. It provides a list of examples of works that may be protected which is similar to that of the Berne Convention. French courts have repeatedly decided works of GI to be subject to copyright. Database Directive 96/9/EC was implemented into law on 1 July 1998 by integrating the new rules into various sections of the French Intellectual Property Code. The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society is transposed by the Law on the digital economy.


No copyright exists in laws, decrees, court decisions, legal texts and so on. Maps belong to the same category as books, music and other artistic creation activities results. They therefore benefit of IPR protection under French law. Copyright is regulated by a system of licences. A licence for internal use exists, and several tariffs are in force depending on the amount of use to which the information is put. Government bodies also grant licences to private companies for the commercialisation of their data.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


French privacy legislation can be found in Law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 (Loi relative à l’informatique, aux fichiers et aux libertés). Most notably this legislation provides for a priori declaration of all databases containing nominative data, and a right of access and correction for information concerning oneself. This law is more protective of private life than many other European equivalent legislations. The Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL - National Commission for Information Technology  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20 and Individual Liberties) is the regulatory body set up to enforce and report on application of French Privacy law ([www.cnil.fr](http://www.cnil.fr/)). On 11 January 2000 the European Commission decided to take France to court for failure to notify all the measures necessary to implement Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data. Article 5 of Law no. 2000-321 of 12 April 2000 already amended Law no. 78-17. However, Directive 95/46/EC is now fully transposed into French law. On 30 January 2002 the French National Assembly therefore adopted a draft implementation law (projet de loi) regarding the processing of personal data, modifying Law no. 78-17. This law has been definitively adopted by an Assemblée National vote on the 29th of April 2004. The law of 22 June 200 concerning the digital economy has transposed both the 1995 directive on the processing of personal data and the 2002 directive on privacy and electronic communications into French law.


**Licensing framework**


The Ordonnance of 6 June 2005 on re-use of PSI states that if charges are made for the re-use, a licence has to be available, which holds the conditions for the re-use. These conditions can only put restrictions on the re-use for the purpose of the general interest, and in a roportionate way. Model licences should be available. Such model licences are provided by APIE, which makes available some model licences for the re-use of PSI on its website, for a one-off delivery and for continuous delivery of information. IGN provides general conditions for the use of its products and services on its website ([www.ign.fr](http://www.ign.fr/)) as well as a set of licences: standard licence, server licence, electronic representation, graphical representation, commercial exploitation, integration, etc. Specific terms are foreseen for the educational sector and the research sector. Parcel data and address data are only available for the public sector. On the geoportal www.geoportail.fr, one can also buy IGN data online. Payment can be done by bank transfer or by credit card. Price lists and terms of use are available on the website (<https://boutiquepro.ign.fr/index.php?event=DisplayInfosProduits>). Over 8000 contracts have been concluded via the Geoportal. Such general conditions are also provided by SHOM. These conditions have been set up in strong cooperation within the IHO Regional Hydrographic Commission for the North Sea (NSHC). Furthermore this NSHC has also established a principle of custodianship, by which a country A portraying on its charts the data owned by an other country B can authorize the re-use of the data of the country B (provided the corresponding fees are yearly paid to country B).


Another maritime example can be found in the Regional Electronic Navigation Chart established under the auspices of the IHO WEND commission: for instance Primar Stavanger, operated by the Norwegian Hydrographic Service, distributes (including  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 21 weekly up-dating) the ENC of several countries, amongst which France.

The main legal provisions with regard to Brussels UrbIS can be found in two decisions of the government of the Brussels Region. The Decision of 19 May 1994 charges the CIBG with all assignments regarding the promotion, distribution and service provision of Brussels UrbIS. The Decision of 4 July 1996 determines the pricing of the services that are offered by Brussels UrbIS. In the same decision, the CIBG is charged with a number of assignments and services, such as the dissemination under licence constraints of Brussels UrbIS and the realisation of cartography activities. Next to adopting the cooperation agreement with regard to INSPIRE mentioned earlier, the Brussels Region also transposed the INSPIRE directive within its own jurisdiction in October 2010. The Ordnance regarding spatial data in the Brussels Region was published and entered into force in November 2010.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Seven utility companies participate in and co-finance Brussels UrbIS. No other recent information on existing PPPs was found.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


In Belgium, the federal level and all regions have to transpose the INSPIRE directive with regard to the data sets and services for which they are competent. For particular aspects regarding coordination and cooperation, the federal level and the regions have concluded a cooperation agreement. The objective of the agreement is the setting up and safeguarding of the application of the general rules of coordination between the different parties in order to enable the compliance with the obligations of the INSPIRE directive and to realise the Belgian contribution to the development of the INSPIRE infrastructure. This agreement installs the INSPIRE Coordination Committee, composed of 2 representatives from each region and the Federal state, the Member State Contact Point, the Belgian representative in the Comitology procedure and the president of the Belgian INSPIRE forum. Next to the Committtee, an INSPIRE cell is installed, which will take over the role of the Member State Contact Point and will take on the secretarial tasks of the Committee, the representative in the the Comitology Procedure and the Forum. The cooperation agreement was adopted on 2 April 2010. It will enter into force when all parties have adopted their own legislation endorsing the agreement. The Brussels Region has published its endorsement in April 2011. The legislative approvals of the other regions and the federal state still have to be published.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The federal state and each region have adopted legislation with regard to access to government information and the re-use of public sector information, each for the information held by the public bodies and the information under their competence. This legislation includes:

In all legal acts, the choice is left to the public bodies whether or not they make their information available for re-use. The only exception to this are the departments of the ministry of the Flemish Region and some of their agencies. For these bodies, allowing the re-use of their documents is mandatory.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Belgian law of 30 June 1994 concerning Copyright and Neighbouring Rights does not expressly mention maps, plans and other works related to geography or topography as being capable of attracting copyright (contrary to the Berne Convention and many other national copyright laws). They do however fall within the category 'works of literature'. According to article 8, §2 of the above Copyright Law, there is no copyright on official documents (e.g. decrees, laws) of the government. Other data produced by the public sector (e.g. geospatial information) can however qualify for copyright protection and can thus be managed and exploited by the public authorities if this data meets the legal conditions for copyright protection. The Belgian law of 31 August 1998 concerning the legal protection of databases (implementation of Directive 96/9/EC of 11 March 1996) and the Belgian law of 30 June EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Belgium K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 1994 concerning the legal protection of computer programs (implementation of Directive 91/250/EC of 14 May 1991) could also offer legal protection to geographic data. The 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society was transposed by the law of 22 May 2005, which includes amendments to the Copyright law and the law on the protection of databases.

Before the development of the UK Location Strategy, no encompassing policy on the coordination of the provision and dissemination of GI existed at the level of central government. A legal framework for the NSDI in the UK was not developed. The Location Strategy is the general strategic document on which the set-up and implementation of the UK NSDI is based. As a part of the Location Strategy, the INSPIRE directive was transposed by the INSPIRE regulations in December 2009. The final text has been published at


<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2009/uksi_20093157_en_1>


 The development of the legal text was preceded by a consultation on the policy principles on which the regulations were based. The consultation showed the need for a further assessment of the costs and benefits, and a need for communication and guidance (see Explanatory Memorandum to the INSPIRE Regulations 2009). Sub-national legislation also exists for Scotland. 


 


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


An important ‘flagship’ project with respect to public-private partnership in the GI-sector is lead by the National Land Information Service (http://www.nlis.org.uk ). This project is providing a service through which it is now possible to search for property details online. The National Land and Property Gazetteer can also be considered as a form of PPP. This is the national address list that has to be updated by the local authorities in England and Wales. The NLPG is a partnership between Local Government Information House, the Improvement and Development Agency, Intelligent Addressing and Local Government Association. General statements about PPP related to GI have not been found.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The UK Parliament broadly signalled its position with regard to the accessibility of public sector information by passing a Freedom of Information Act in 2000, which came into full force in January 2005. The Act has received considerable criticism from many politicians across the political spectrum and NGOs as being insufficient and weaker than the existing code of practice. In June 2002, the Scottish Parliament approved a Freedom of Information bill that is regarded as stronger than the English Freedom of Information Act. It also will not go into effect until 2005. Free access by the citizen to information on EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 United Kingdom K.U.Leuven (SADL) 14 the environment has however been specified since 1992 by a Statutory Instrument, which was replaced by new Regulations in January 2005. The Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2005 (Statutory Instrument 2005 No. 1515), transposing Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI came into force on 1 July 2005. The regulations do not impose a general obligation on the public sector bodies to make their documents available for re-use. A public sector body may permit re-use, and if it decides to do so, it has to comply with the regulations. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI), which has a regulatory function for PSI holders has merged with The National Archives with effect from October 2006. The merger created a stronger centre for information management in the public sector, enabling a more responsive approach to the challenges of new technology. The combined organisation will be known as The National Archives, which will continue to operate as a government department and as an executive agency of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs ([http://www.opsi.gov.uk](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/)). 


A number of studies have been done in the UK to show the value of availability of public sector data under non-restrictive conditions and at a charge of marginal costs or lower (e.g. the Office of Fair Trading’s report on Commercial Use of Public Information, the Power of Information Report, the Cambridge Report on Models of Public Sector Information Provision via Trading Funds). These studies paved the way for initiatives of the Office of Public Sector Information and other public bodies to start opening up data. In June 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown enlisted Sir Tim Berners-Lee to help move the British public sector towards opening up its data (Cabinet Office 2009). Following this initiative, the data.gov.uk website was launched in January 2010, with currently over 3,000 datasets that are available for re-use, free of charge and without use restrictions. During 2010, the Public Sector Transparency Board was established by the Prime Minister with the objective to drive forward the Government’s Transparency Agenda and promoting the opening up of government data.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Part I on copyright of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 extends to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It came into force on 1 August 1989. Chapter X of Part I of this Act has some special provisions on Crown and Parliamentary copyright. This 1988 Act provided a major updating of copyright law but the process has continued since then with a number of amendments. EU Directive 96/9/EC of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases was implemented by the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulation 1997, coming into force on 1 January 1998. The Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992 came into force on 1ste January 1993. Both Regulations made amendments to the above Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The amendments to the Copyright Act that transposed the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society into English law came into force on October 31st, 2003. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 United Kingdom K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 In the UK, government geo-information is strongly protected by far reaching Crown copyright. No other country has a system quite like it. Crown copyright is defined in the above Act as a work made by Her Majesty or by an officer or servant of the Crown in the course of his duties. It covers a wide range of material, including legislation, government codes of practice, Ordnance Survey mapping, government reports, official press releases, government forms and many public records. There are however public sector copyright owners other than the Crown, such as local authorities and non-departmental public bodies (NDPB). These are thus not subject to Crown copyright control. The UK system of Crown copyright does however apply to Ordnance Survey  [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/)


which holds a strong market position as far as geographic products is concerned. It is responsible for mapping at all the scales. The Ordnance Survey therefore exercises a virtual monopoly in the provision of mapping through the enforcement of Crown copyright.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Parliament approved the Data Protection Act in July 1998, which came into force on 1 March 2000. This Act updates the 1984 Data Protection Act in accordance with the requirements of the EU Directive 95/46/EC. The 1998 Act covers records held by government agencies and private entities. It provides for limitations on the use of personal information, access to and correction of records and requires that entities that maintain records, register with the Information Commissioner [http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk](http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/)


The Office of the Information Commissioner is an independent agency that maintains the register and enforces the Act. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into English law.


**Licensing framework**


Public sector information regulated by Crown Copyright is licensed by the Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) at The National Archives (TNA) but for many geographic datasets, the data providers have their own licensing policy, e.g. Ordnance Survey, British Geological Survey,  nvironment Agency, and Met Office. However, TNA works with these agencies (and with local authorities and other public bodies) to harmonise licensing policies, by giving advice, providing guidelines and by managing the Information Fair Trader Scheme. The Information Fair Trader Scheme (IFTS) ensures that re-users of public sector information can be confident that they will be treated reasonably and fairly by public sector information providers. All Crown bodies that have a licensing delegation from the Controller of OPSI (such as Ordnance Survey) must join the Scheme, but it is open to public sector organisations to join voluntarily. Public bodies that are accredited under the scheme include Ordnance Survey, Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland, British Geological Survey, Registers of Scotland and the UK Hydrographic Office.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 United Kingdom K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 In June 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown enlisted Sir Tim Berners-Lee to help move the British public sector towards opening up its data (Cabinet Office 2009). Following this initiative, the data.gov.uk website was launched in January 2010, with currently over 3,000 datasets that are available for re-use, free of charge and without use restrictions under the Open Government Licence. The only conditions involve attribution (see


<http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-governmentlicence/opengovernmentlicence.htm>


 


The UK Location Data Sharing Operational Guidance establishes the UK Government Licensing Framework as the basis for licensing the use of datasets that are part of UK Location. When the location data is available without further restrictions, conditions or charges, the Open Government Licence will be used as the default licence. For other data, new licence models are being developed. (UK Location, UK Location Data Sharing Operational Guidance Part 2 – Licensing and Charging, <http://location.defra.gov.uk/2011/03/data-sharing-operational-guidance/>


 


In March 2010, Ordnance Survey decided to make some of its datasets openly available under the OS Open Data Licence, using the same licence terms as the data.gov.uk website. See <http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1529556>


 Since November 2010, a new licensing and pricing model was launched for the Ordnance Survey data that was not subject to the OS Open Data Licence (see


<http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/business/licences/2010-model.html>


 


Next to its regular licensing policies, Ordnance Survey also has a number of Collective Licensing Agreements, for instance with the National Health Service, and with central bodies under the Pan-Government Agreements. Since April 2009, Ordnance Survey and Landmark have launched a new version of the Pan-Government Agreement for 4 years, providing national bodies with access to a broader set of data at an affordable price (see

The main legal instruments on the federal level include the federal law on access to geographic data (Gesetz über den Zugang zu digitalen Geodaten -Geodatenzugangsgesetz – GeoZG) and the Administration Agreement, signed by the..."	German-Legal Framework	"**Legal framework**


The main legal instruments on the federal level include the federal law on access to geographic data (Gesetz über den Zugang zu digitalen Geodaten -Geodatenzugangsgesetz – GeoZG) and the Administration Agreement, signed by the federal government and all the Länder. The Geodatenzugangsgesetz, which implements INSPIRE for the federal level, was published in 2008 and entered into force in February 2009. The Act creates a legal framework to access spatial data, spatial data services and metadata from the federal geodata holders, primarily aimed at environmental protection (M. Badowski, EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Germany K. U. Leuven (SADL) 24 Implementation of the INSPIRE-Directive in Germany and Poland – Legal Point of View). The laws of the 16 Länder are very alike the federal law, based on a common strategy for the transposition and a common template for the law that was agreed on by all Länder and the federal state. Nine Länder have already adopted their legislation, with the other seven to follow in 2010.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Within the context of INSPIRE implementation the German SDI (GDI-DE) is opened for third parties: As long as they accept the underlying principles of GDI-DE and the regulations of GeoZG third parties may contribute their geo data and metadata using the geoportal of GDI-DE. They just have to ensure the compliance with the technical rules defined by the GeoZG, the INSPIRE implementing rules and the GDI-DE Architecture. In that respect the work of the INSPIRE Task Force can be seen as an example of a PPP. Representatives of the government, scientific institutions and enterprises cooperate to coordinate the outcome of European and national legislation with the technical development within GDI-DE. Establishment of GDI-DE itself is done with major participation of the ""Commission of Geo-Information Industry"" on the conceptual level.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The Federation implemented the European Directive 2003/98/EG on PSI into national law in 2006 by adopting the ""Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz"" (IWG – reuse of public sector information). The IWG regulates the Federal as well as the Federal state and municipal administrative level. Furthermore the Federation in September 2005 adopted the ""Informationsfreiheitsgesetz"" (IFG – free access to public information)"", granting each person an unconditional right to access official federal information. ‘Freedom of information laws’ have been adopted at the regional level by some of the Länder. In Brandenburg the right to freedom of information was explicitly laid down in legislation (constitution) in 1998. It relates to the right of all citizens to access public records held by state authorities, districts and cities, unless public or private interests prevail. Berlin, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, MecklenburgVorpommern, Hamburg, Bremen, Saarland and Thüringen have also recently adopted freedom of information laws. Other federal states are still preparing their FOI laws. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been implemented by the German Environmental Information Law (Umweltinformationsgesetz - UIG), which passed the German Parliament on 22nd of December 2004. UIG defines the facilities which are affected, describes the access to environmental as well as rejection of access, active dissemination of environmental information and fees. It has entered into force on 14 February 2005. The main instrument to support access to environmental information is

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


In Germany the national legislator is competent to issue copyright regulation and other intellectual property laws. The federal states are not allowed to issue state laws that contradict national laws. The German Copyright Act (Urheberrechtgesetz – UrhG) explicitly states that works of literature, science or art have to be original to enjoy copyright protection. Since products of geographical information are functional, their level of originality tends to be rather low. Works with a low level of originality such as geographic maps, tables and so on enjoy copyright protection if some creativity has come into play, for instance in the generalisation process that is inherent in map production, or in the selection and arrangement of data. However, if the level of originality is low, protection granted is similarly low. Photographic works that are original are covered by common copyright. The German Copyright Act however has a special clause that gives the creator of a non-original photograph a right to resist duplication (art. 72 UrhG). The Directives 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases and 91/250/EC on the legal protection of computer programs have been fully integrated in German Copyright Act.


According to article 5 of the Copyright Act, government information is not subject to copyright. Government information is divided into two categories. One category encompasses laws, decrees and so on (article 5(1)), whereas another category deals with official works published in the official interest for public information (article 5(2)). Interpretation of this last article is however very strict since – according to the Supreme Court – it only applies to information that is meant to be made generally available and copied.


The different federal states laws that regulate the work of the surveying and mapping authorities contain clauses that regulate the use of information collected or produced by them. The 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society was transposed by the Gesetzzur Regelung des Urheberrechts in der Informationsgesellschaft of 10 September 2003.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Protection of privacy has a long tradition in Germany and is considered tantamount to a human right. Hence privacy and personal data laws in Germany are generally very restrictive. Spatial datasets that contain information on individuals are in principle subject to the German laws on the protection of privacy. To ensure protection of privacy when implementing the INSPIRE-Directive, the Federal commissioner for data protection was involved when drafting GeoZG. The Federal Data Protection Act of 20 December 1990 Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) – as already amended by the law of 14 September 1994 – was later amended by the Federal Data Protection Act of 18 May 2001. This latest act implements Directive 95/46/EC and came into force on 23 May 2001. The Federal Data Protection Act applies to the federal public sector and the private sector. All federal states (except Sachsen and Bremen) adopted new Data Protection Laws to implement the EU Directive. These acts apply to the public sector of the respective federal states.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Germany K. U. Leuven (SADL) 26 A particularity of German data protection law lies in the fact that in addition to the above Federal Data Protection Act there are numerous sector-specific provisions. All these rules are granting the data subject a variety of possibilities aiming at the respect of his individual data protection rights. The use of (public) geodata is also restricted by the cadastral laws at the federal state level. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communication has been transposed in German law.


**Licensing framework**


Each German authority or agency currently defines its own data policy on a case-by-case basis under the direction of the appropriate Minister. The GDI-DE Steering Committee, GIW-Commission, IMAGI, DDGI and AdV are all – directly or indirectly – working towards the development of a harmonised and simplified licensing framework for GI. A framework to get comparable prices for geo data was adopted by IMAGI in 2006, (see 2.3.7). One of the tasks of AdV is also to deliberate on the costs. These bodies thus have a mission in eveloping a pricing policy for GI.


A good example for simplifying licensing processes is the contract between the Federal states and the Federal Ministry for Interior to provide reference datasets from the federal states to the Federal Administration. It regulates an annual all-inclusive payment from federation to the federal states, which enables the BKG to provide all topographic data sets and services to Federal Agencies for free. In order to further coordinate and simplify the licensing policies for geographic data, the GDI-DE is currently working on licensing templates for spatial data sets and services, aiming at the gradual harmonisation of licences. The provision of licences via standardised web services is in preparation."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

MinVROM is the formal responsible for GI-related matters in The Netherlands. The results of the NSDI-initiative are partially integrated in legal instruments:


A key element of the NSDI is the “authentic registers”. Authentic registrations are registrations with a uniquely defined core dataset, which government agencies are obligated to use. The collection and maintenance of the data is regulated in legislation, the data certified as accurate and current, and the producer assumes all liability for its use by others. Access to data in authentic registers should be conformal the guidelines presented in the memorandum towards accessible government (transparency on data policy). Its users are obliged to report incorrect information to producers, and there is a stringent policy on quality assurance. 


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The etherlands


K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20


The authentic registrations include several datasets that can be considered as geographic datasets.


 First, the law making Top10NL of the Cadastre the authentic registration for topography was adopted in January 2008 by amendments to the Law on the Cadastre. From 1 January 2009, all public bodies in the Netherlands are under an obligation to use it. Local authorities that had their own 1:10.000 topographic maps had to make the switch by 1 January 2010. In addition, the derived 1:50.000, 1:100.000, 1:250.000, 1:500.000 and 1:1.000.000 are also part of the authentic registration for topography. A convenant was signed between the Ministry of VROM and the Cadastre about the maintenance of the registration.


Second, the authentic registration for addresses and buildings was included in the law of 24 January 2008 (which was amended on 14 February 2009). The law entered into force on 1 July 2009, and the local authorities are since then under the obligation to deliver their address and building data to the national registry. From 1 July 2011, the registration has to be used by all public bodies. For the third authentic registration, the large-scale topography (1:500 to 1:5.000), draft legislation was intended to be issued in early 2010. The fourth authentic registration, subsurface, will be fully operational by 2013. This was approved by a Decision from the cabinet in December 2008. Another important legal instrument is the law 2 July 2009 transposing the INSPIRE directive into Dutch law. The law stays close to the directive, requires the public authorities to create metadata and gives everyone the right to use the network services. The rules for sharing data have to be set up by a ministerial decree.


**Public-private partnerships (PPP’s)**


In 1975, by Royal Degree, the Large Scale Base Map of the Netherlands (GBKN -Grootschalige Basiskaart van Nederland) was established. After a long period of development, in 1992 the LSV-GBKN (Landelijk Samenwerkingverband – National Cooperation GBKN) was established which finished the production of the GBKN in 1999. The LSV-GBKN was a national joint venture with 11 regional joint ventures. The production costs are €20 million and nationwide fully covered. It is a PPP of the municipalities, utility companies, water boards, the Dutch Cadastre and the Dutch administration. After the GBKN moves to the authentic registration large scale topography, the maintenance will be a public task and the PPP construction will no longer be maintained. Between 2001 and 2007, the private company Geodan had taken over the exploitation and the management of the NCGI. From 2007 onwards, the NGCI was replaced by GEONOVUM. 


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The Netherlands


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


The legal basis for access to public information is the Government Information Public Access Act of 31 October 1991. This act replaced the Act on Public Access to Information of 9 November 1978. It creates a presumption that documents created by a public agency should be available to everyone. The law provides for access to information that is crucial in the decision making process of the administration. The price to be paid for this information is based on dissemination cost. It is reasoned however that the electronic geographic data cannot be obtained through a request based on this Act. Government agencies can claim copyright or database right on their data and most of them do so. Moreover, citizens or businesses cannot access entire databases because -according to current interpretation- the Government Information Act does not apply to complete databases.


Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information was implemented in Dutch law by the Act of 30 September 2004, modifying the Government Information Public Access Act, the Act on environmental management and other Acts. The Government Information Public Access Act has been revised to include the implementation of Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI. In 2009, the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced that it would review the legislation implementing the PSI directive. While the Dutch policy already went beyond the minimum requirements of the directive (thanks to the policy document ‘Naar de optimal beschikbaarheid van overheidsinformatie – Towards the optimal availability of public sector information), this will be translated into the legislation. The new legislation is intended to be brought before Parliament before the end of 2010. Its main principles are: the adaptation of the pricing principle towards the charging of only marginal costs; the banning of public sector bodies to use their intellectual property rights to impose conditions on re-use; and the creation of transitory rules for a number of data collections, including the Cadastre, allowing for the adaptation of their funding model.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Copyright is primarily regulated by the Copyright Act of 1912. The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society has been included into national legislation. In principle, copyright is applicable to all government information -with the exception of official texts of legislation, judicial decisions and administrative decrees-, although copyright must be claimed explicitly by the government for the protection to be effective and a copyright sign (©) has to be placed on the work. Commercial use of the data for which copyright is claimed by an administrative agency is only allowed when the agency concerned gives its consent. Due to their factual and standardized character geographic information often does not meet the requirements of originality required by copyright. However, common law shows that geo-information with a personal view can still be protected by copyright.  


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The Netherlands 


Based on the European Directive on the legal protection of databases (96/9/EC), the 1912 Copyright Act was amended and a Dutch version of the Directive, the Database Law, enacted in 1999. The new law protects the producer of a database which shows that there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents. Government agencies explicitly have to reserve their rights. In a Decision on a case between the City of Amsterdam and Landmark, the Council of State (the highest administrative court) decided that the city could not be considered a producer of the database, because it did not bear the risk of the substantial investment in the database, as the data was partially obtained from the national ministry, and partially paid for by the city of Amsterdam in order to facilitate the performance of its public task. The court found that there was no financial risk, so the city could not invoke its database right to impose conditions on the re-use by Landmark. The new legislation on PSI will ban the public sector bodies from using their intellectual property rights to restrict the re-use of their data.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Netherlands Data Registration Act was passed in 1989 and applies to all collections of personal data, regardless of residency status in the Netherlands. It also applies to foreign files having a Dutch file controller and containing personal data about Netherlands residents. A new Personal Data Protection Act (Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens – WBP) was approved by the parliament in June 2000 and implements EU Directive 95/46/EG. It came into force on 1 September 2001. Although geographic data primarily focuses on geographic objects and not on natural persons, and even might be presented in an anonymous way, an operator can often easily relate these data to natural persons. In most cases the law oncerning privacy protection is therefore applicable to geo-information. Hence, each organization or business should notify persons that they have been registered and for what purpose. 


Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been implemented in national law by several regulations and an act of 22 April 2004 in particular. For an overview of the acts implementing this directive, see <http://europa.eu.int/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/implementation_enforcement/country_by_country/netherlands_2002_58.pdf>.


Particular attention to privacy and personal data is also paid in the legislation on the authentic registration for buildings and addresses.

GEONOVUM, in cooperation with T.U.Delft, has started working on a licensing model based on creative commons, called Geo gedeeld. It proposes four sets of standard EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The Netherlands K.U.Leuven (SADL) 23 licensing conditions. All licences contain an obligation of attribution, and may contain one or more of the following conditions: 


 Permission is required to make the data available to third parties or to create derived products; The licence has a limited duration;  A charge has to be paid for using the data. The model was discussed with the data holders and adapted to their needs. It will be implemented in the course of 2010."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The Infrastructure for Spatial Information Act was adopted by the Parliament in December 2008 and entered into force on 15 May 2009. The Act sets the framework for the further  evelopment of the Danish SDI. KMS is now assigned to manage the infrastructure for spatial information in Denmark. The Act contains two additions to the provisions stemming from the INSPIRE directive. Firstly, the Danish minister for the Environment can extend the scope of the Act to data outside of the Annexes of the INSPIRE directive, after negotiations with the minister responsible for these data.


Secondly, the Minister can also determine, in collaboration with other public sector parties, which data should be used as the foundation and the official sources for mapping and registration (KMS, Infrastructure for spatial data in Denmark 2009.


Also in 2009, agreements for the use of spatial data were concluded with central government (National Geodata Agreement) and with all municipalities (Municipal Geodata Agreement). These agreements took effect from 2010.


The Danish policy on spatial data infrastructures is closely linked to the eGovernment policy. The rules and guidelines for spatial data should help increase their value for eGovernment policy.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The Danish SDI has a history of successful public-private cooperation. For instance, the digital national topographic database TOP10DK was created as a PPP in 2000; and the digitization of the Cadastre in the 1990s took place in cooperation between the public and the private sector.


Cooperation between the public and the private sector is considered very important for the development of the Danish NSDI. The public bodies specify the data requirements, conduct data quality assurance and distribute the data. The private companies collect the data and contribute technical solutions for accessibility (Jesper Jarmbæk, The Danish Way: Development of the Danish Spatial Data Infrastructure through Binding Collaboration, 


<http://www.gsdi.org/gsdi11/papers/pdf/179.pdf>）


 


KMS offers maps and data via an API called Map Supply

The Cadastre has formed partnerships with a number of companies that develop applications for users.

**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The general right of access to government held information is laid down in Act no. 572 of 19 December 1985 on Access to Public Administration Files (Lov om offentlighed i forvaltningen). Public administration in the sense of this Act means all public bodies of central and local government, excluding Parliament and the Courts. Utility companies are also subject to the Access Act, but other private sector companies with public tasks generally are not. There are various grounds for denying access, for instance confidentiality of the files in question and privacy. More important, access may be limited out of consideration for public financial interests, which includes the interest of public sector bodies that undertake activities of a commercial nature.


Directive 2003/4 and the provisions of the Aarhus Convention have been included in the Access to Environmental Information Act.. Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI has been implemented by Law no. 596 of 24 June 2005. The Law was amended by Act no. 551 of 17 June 2008, which entered into force on 1 July 2008. The amendment widened the law and included Parliamentary and Court .


In June 2008, this analysis prompted the government’s economic committee to pass a new agreement on financing central government authorities’ access to geodata and services from the National Survey and Cadastre. The new framework took effect at January 1, 2009. This agreement grants all ministries full access to geodata and relevant services from the National Survey and Cadastre. Rather than paying traditional usage fees, each ministry will pay a fixed annual contribution based on its use and needs. The agreement underlines the National Survey and Cadastre’s role as the central government’s infrastructure organisation for maps and geodata. The framework provides all ministries and agencies, universities and  lementary- and secondary- schools and with access to the majority of the Cadastre’s geodata holdings, as well as access to these geodata over the Internet through the Digital Map Supply.


The main provisions:


 The whole of central government will have access to data from the National Survey and Cadastre, increasing the data’s value.


 Whole of central government will help finance the data’s maintenance.


 Each ministry’s payment is fixed according to its estimated geodata benefit, and the payment encompasses all institutions within the ministry.


 The central government’s procurement of geodata will be better coordinated. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Denmark K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16


Elements covered by the agreement:


 Topographical data collections


 Reference network data


 The Danish Digital Elevation Model


 Property register maps and data


 Nautical chart data


 Web services for retrieving and displaying geodata, including the Digital Map Supply In a similar agreement between the local authorities and KMS, municipalities have since 2010 free access to a range of major spatial data and spatial data services from the National Survey and Cadastre. Under the 2002 agreement on ‘Better access to public data’, the Building and Dwelling Register (BBR) address data are made available to public and private users, including for commercial purposes at the cost of distribution only. The objective of the agreement was to establish a broad and intensive use of the official Danish address data in both the public and private sector. The BBR address data are made available as a download service through the Public Information Server (OIS) and as an online network service using Address Web Services (AWS). The latter is offered by the Ministry of Economics and  usiness Affairs in cooperation with KMS, which makes the spatial AWS services available as SOAP and Web Map Services (WMS).


The Danish Nature and Environment Portal is a joint public-sector partnership between the Ministry of the Environment, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions. The aim is to support the environmental public bodies to fulfil their responsibilities, ensure a uniform and updated core of environmental data, promote digital procedures in the environmental area and strengthen communication with the public.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Copyright Act became effective as of 1 January 1996. This Act consolidated and systematically modernised Danish copyright legislation, replacing the old Copyright Act from 1961. The main Act (Act no. 395 of 14 June 1995) has already been amended several times (Act no. 295 of 24 April 1996 and Act no. 1207 of 27 December 1996). The EU atabase Directive was incorporated into the Danish Copyright Act by Act no. 407 of 26 June 1998. The current provisions are now found in Consolidated Act no. 706 of 29 September 1998.


Section 9 of the Copyright Act provides that laws, administrative orders, legal decisions and similar official documents are not subject to copyright. This exemption does not extend to works appearing as independent contributions in the documents (e.g. a EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Denmark K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 copyrighted map that is part of an administrative decision on urban development).


Although these works may be copied together with the rest of the document that is not subject to copyright, in further exploitation the rights of the copyright owner must be respected.There is a special situation about old topographic maps, where KMS has a time unlimited copyright.


Until 1995, photographs were protected by the Photography Act. This Act has been repealed and the protection of photographs has been incorporated into the Copyright Act. A photograph may enjoy protection either as an actual copyrighted work or as a photographic picture. The difference lies both in the material provisions on legal protection and in the timeframe. The right to a photographic picture lasts 50 years from the end of the year in which the picture was taken, whereas a copyrighted work enjoys protection for 70 years after the year of the author's death. All objects made by the aid of the reaction of light-sensitive material shall be considered as a photographic picture. Denmark has implemented the 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Directive 95/46/EC was implemented into Danish legislation by the Act on the Processing of Personal Data (Act no. 429) of 31 May 2000 (Lov om behandling af personoplysninger), which entered into force on 1 July 2000. This Act substitutes the Public Authorities' Registers Act and the Private Registers Act, both of which became law on 1 January 1979. The Danish Data Protection Agency exercises surveillance over processing of data to which the Act applies. Denmark has implemented Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications with a framework of regulations. 


 


**Licensing framework**


Data from KMS is accessible to the public via Digital Map Supply. For downloading purposes, the KMS website makes a distinction between professional users and other users. For the former, several products are delivered via web-services, online services, CD-ROM, DVD and photocopies. Other users are referred to resellers of paper maps. In 2009 and 2010, agreements were concluded between KMS and the central government and between KMS and the municipalities. Under the National Geodata Agreement, all ministries, agencies, universities and elementary and secondary schools get access to KMS data, such as topographic data, reference network data, DEM, cadastral data and nautical charts. They get access to the web services and Digital Map Supply. A  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Denmark K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 coordination forum is established to manage the Agreement (Jesper Jarmbæk, The Danish Way: Development of the Danish Spatial Data Infrastructure through Binding Collaboration, http://www.gsdi.org/gsdi11/papers/pdf/179.pdf). Under the Municipal Geodata Agreement, the local authorities obtain access to the data and web services of KMS. KMS also has agreements with the Armed Forces and the regions. In January, the National Geodata Agreement came into effect, and all ministries gained access to the National Survey and Cadastre’s geodata and web services. A similar Municipal Geodata Agreement was reached with Local Government Denmark in 2009, and will come into effect in 2010. The National Survey and Cadastre and the Armed Forces have an existing agreement on geodata and web services access; the country’s five regions have also inherited the geodata access agreements that were held by the former counties. This agreement supported an increased interest in the application of spatial data to new areas including health, environment, defence and mergency management.


Meanwhile, municipalities continue joining a number of collaborative efforts. These include the development of unified nationwide topographic data through FOT Denmark and the acquisition of the Danish Digital Elevation Model, which was produced and quality-controlled in accordance with official requirements. The Danish Digital Elevation Model was purchased in 2007 with user rights for all central government bodies and is today one of the services which may be accessed under the National Geodata Agreement. At the end of 2010, also 89 of the country’s 98 municipalities had obtained user rights for the Danish Digital Elevation Model."					Thursday, June 9, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Spatial Data Infrastructure of Uruguay (IDEuy) is an initiative of the National Executive Branch, coordinated by the AGESIC (Agency for the Management of Electronic Government and Information Society and Knowledge), which aims to position itself as an essential instrument to support decision-making through the use of geographic information. Since its inception, has sought to coordinate IDEuy, standaridze and make available geographic information generated in the country. This has been possible thanks to the valuable contribution made by public agencies on their contributions both in the information and technicians who have participated in working groups.


The beginning of the Spatial Data Infrastructure in Uruguay has been the result of an evolutionary process in which various institutions have participated.There have been several milestones that helped in the realization of the objectives. However, it can be considered that the creation of Spatial Data Infrastructure of Uruguay born with the sanction of the executive decree of June 16, 2006. It includes the need to create a National Cadastre and the coordination of spatial data infrastructure nationwide. In order to optimize the performance of IDEuy have been created within AGESIC two advisory groups: the CAHSIG and GTIDE. The first with a strategic vision while the second with a technical function. Some of the objectives to be achieved are:


- Compatibility between IG. - Avoid the lack of coordination, duplication of functions.


- Use human and material resources efficiently.


- Use common rules and standards for processes involving the handling of geographical indications."					Tuesday, July 5, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The government of Bahrain has long recognized thesignificance of spatial information to the planning, governance of the nationand provision of public services. This has resulted in the formation of theNational GIS Steering Committee in compliance to the decree issued by the PrimeMinister in the year 2004. The GIS Directorate, CIO at the helm of theinitiative, with directives from NGISSC has taken several progressive stepstowards the implementation of Spatial Data Infrastructure in the Kingdom toaddress the issues pertaining to geospatial data, standards, copy right,licensing, data liability, data security, 5 cost coordination and recovery.BSDI is aligned with the Kingdom’s broader policies rather than just immediateproblem solving and supports Bahrain 2030 vision in developing a world classinfrastructure links to Bahrain Global economy. A strategic plan was developedwith a purpose to ""Implement Bahrain Spatial Data Infrastructure (BSDI) bycreating the national GIS data clearinghouse and foster the development of afully integrated GIS system"". 

The following specific steps are being conducted: 

·Prototype implementation

 ·Building on the Foundation

 ·Strengthening the Community There is a significant level of co-dependenciesamong the components and tasks.

 These hasbeen identified and reflected in the development of the plan refinement and anassociated work breakdown structure (WBS).

 A phased planis conceived, as follows: 

Phase 1 - Initiation (June 2004 to June 2005). 

Phase 2 - Building on the Foundation (June 2005 toJune 2007). 

Phase 3 - Strengthening the Community (June 2007 toJune 2009). 6 

Phase 4 - Creating a unified and integrated NationalSpatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) that supports all Governmental andNon-Governmental bodies in Planning, Decision-making and day-to-day management(2009 – 2011). 

Phase 5 - Fully operational SDI database satisfyingPublic & Private Sector end users (2011 – 2012). 

Phase 6 - Increasing role of Private Sector inGeospatial domain (2012 – 2013). 

Phase 7 - Operational cost recovery (about 40%, 2013– 2014). 

Phase 8 - New Bahraini citizens qualified graduatesto supplement market needs in GIS (2014 – 2016). 

The fundamental policies that has been documented inthe “Bahrain Data Exchange Policy” and that relate to the access anddistribution of Geospatial data for the Kingdom of Bahrain includes thefollowing

 ·All geospatial stakeholders and users should have easy, efficient and equitableaccess to fundamental datasets through the BSDI portal where technology, dataformats, institutional arrangements, location, costs and conditions do notinhibit its use.

 ·Highly specialized data of a sensitive or proprietary nature may not be madeavailable to all stakeholders. It would be the responsibility of the Custodianto mention these details when sharing data. Sharing of these data may howeverbe subjected to copyright and licensing restriction while distribution withprior consent from the Custodian. 

·Data produced and shared by Government Organizations should be made availableto all other Government Stakeholders free of charge. For Private entitiesrequesting access to the kingdoms spatial datasets, a reasonable fee may belevied on data sharing.

 ·Commercial data including satellite images would be procured by CIO and wouldbe provided free of charge to all Government Entities participating in BSDI.However a reasonable fee decided and approved by NGISS would be charged toprivate organizations that require access to these data."

**1.1** **Basic Act for the Advancement ofUtilizing Geospatial Information** 

The Government enacteda new act “Basic Act for the Advancement of Utilizing Geospatial Information”(hereinafter, “NSDI Act”) in May 2007. The purpose of this act is to advancepolicies concerning the Advancement of Utilizing Geospatial Information(hereinafter, “AUGI”) in a comprehensive and well-planned manner byestablishing basic principles and clarifying the responsibilities of nationaland local governments as well as specifying basic elements for measures onAUGI, in view of the fact that AUGI is essential in establishing the economyand society in which the people can lead a safe and quality life at present andin the future. Given that geospatial information, including geospatialframework information, statistical information and geo-imagery, providesessential infrastructure for the improvement of the quality of the people’sliving and the sound development of the national economy, the NSDI Act providesthat AUGI shall be conducted based on the comprehensive and systematicimplementation of policies including accurate and proper development anddistribution of digital geospatial information, promotion of technologies likethe Geographic Information System (GIS) and Satellite-Based Positioning (SBP),capacity building, enhancement of coordination among national and localgovernments and related institutions.

 **1.2Basic Plan for the Advancement of Utilizing Geospatial Information** 

In order to carry out policies concerning AUGI in acomprehensive and well-planned manner in accordance with the provision in theNSDI Act, the Committee for the AUGI developed “Basic plan for the Advancementof Utilizing Geospatial Information” in 2008 (Cabinet decision on April 15,2008). In the Basic Plan, basic strategies for the policies concerning AUGI,measures related to GIS and policies related to Space-based Positioning,Navigation and Timing (Space-based PNT) are 2 stated. The period of the BasicPlan is set for fiscal years 2008-2011. To promote measures formulated in thisBasic Plan, the Action Plan for the Advancement of Utilizing GeospatialInformation (G-Spatial Action Plan) was enacted in August 2008. Under theG-Spatial Action Plan, the GSI is carrying out a number of various importantmeasures including preparation, improvement, upgrading, provision, andstandardization of geospatial information such as Fundamental Geospatial Data."

The legal framework for the Norwegian SDI goes back to theLand Division Act 1995 and the Land Registration Act of 2005. The latter wasadapted in 2007, and the amendments have entered into force in January 2010,linking the Cadastre to the national Register, the cultural heritage registerand the register for polluted areas. Norway which is part of the EuropeanEconomic Area (EEA) has always followed closely the INSPIRE initiative. The EEAdecided in 2010 to apply INSPIRE as well even though the member countries arenot member of the EU. In order to implement INSPIRE there is a new law whichshould be approved by the parliament before summer 2010. This new law, calledGeodata Act is broader than Norway Digital since the initiative only deals withthe public sector, not the public. A discussion took place during thepreparation of the law on what is public sector and what not. Although the lawis very brief, it goes further than a simple translation of INSPIRE. The lawwill be complemented by bylaws (comparable to the implementing rules ofINSPIRE). The law is different in that 1) it can also deal with other data thanunder INSPIRE; 2) the duties are not applicable for all authorities in the sameway (e.g. municipalities should not make their geodata accessible themselves5).

Other important elements are the Freedom of Information Act,the Public Administration Act and the Act on the re-use of public sectorinformation (cf. infra). International conventions and agreements also have animpact on the arrangements of the SDI work in Norway. As a member oforganisations like IMO, IHO and IALA, Norway has obligations towards theinternational maritime community. 

Of vital importance for the Norwegian SDI, is the June 2003White Paper of the Parliament Stortingsmelding nr. 30 (2002-2003) entitled“Norway Digital: A Joint Fundament for Value-adding”. This paper defined theconcept of the Norwegian SDI, starting from the development of Norway Digital,a geo-portal in cooperation between a large number of public authorities, bothon the national and the regional level (counties and municipalities). Theportal should offer view services free of charge, while download services are providedvia commercial distributors and value-added resellers. The public authoritiesagree to pay an annual fee based on the size of the organisation and theimportance of the datasets for its activities (see further). 

Norway Digital is closely related to the eNorway 2009 ActionPlan for a digital society. This action plan focuses on three main targets: theindividual in the digital Norway, innovation and growth in business andindustry, and a coordinated and user-adapted public sector. Norway Digital is seenas part of the second target. 

Before the agreements on Norway Digital were concluded, theNorwegian public authorities already cooperated in the domain of large scaledigital geographic data under the Geovekst programme. The general agreement onGeovekst was signed in June 1992 by the State Road Department, the Board ofElectricity Companies, the Norwegian 5 It is felt that implementing rules, whoare applicable for all public authorities, thus also for the local authorities,may cause certain problems. E.g. most local authorities might not be able topublish their data through web services. Norway 20 Association of LocalAuthorities, the Norwegian Mapping Authority and Telecommunication Department.The Ministry of Agriculture joined the co-operation half a year later (.KareKyrkjeeide, GEOVEKST: Norwegian cooperation on reference data). 

**Public-privatepartnerships** 

Public-private partnerships have been in place since thedevelopment of Geovekst, and this has continued under Norway Digital. Theproduction under Geovekst is generally outsourced to private companies Severalcompanies have worked or are working with the NMA via collaboration agreements.The Norway Mapping Group, for example, is an alliance of seven major Norwegiancompanies offering mapping systems and services regarding GI technology thatconcluded such a collaboration agreement with the NMA. Another example is theAssociation of Enterprises in Geomatics (GBL), an association of privatecompanies involved in the data production for Geovekst. In the standardisationfield there is a broad co-operation between both public and privatestakeholders that has led to a core national standard SOSI that is accepted byall stakeholders in Norway for more than 15 years. 

**Policy andlegislation on access to public sector information** 

Norwayhas aFreedom of Information Act. This act is giving any member of the public a rightto access public files. (Act no. 69 of 19 June 1970 relating to public accessto documents in the public administration, as amended by Act no. 47 of 11 June1982, Act no. 86 of 17 December 1982 and Act no. 7 of 10 January 1997). In 1985this right was extended to computerised files. Since May 2003, a law relatingto environmental information transposed the rules of the Aarhus Convention: Actof 9 May 2003 No.31 relating to the right to environmental information andpublic participation in decisionmaking processes relating to the environment. Theact entered into force on 1 January 2004. 

The national plan eNorge 2005 -published in May 2002-includes a strategy to increase access to PSI and exploit electronic content(Strategi for Elektronisk Innhold). This action plan was followed up by the eNorway2009 Action plan, which included an action to promote the re-use of PSI. Thegovernment was given the task to develop a holistic and clear pricing policyand to put forward guidelines on when PSI should be charged for. Norway Digitalwas asked to make its information available to commercial players. 

Even though the Norwegian authorities were aware of the needfor a PSI policy, the PSI directive was only transposed by a new Act on theright to access to objects in the public sector (Offentlighetsloven), whichcame into force on 1 January 2009. 

During the visit in May 2010, it was said that the newGeodata Act does not full comply with PSI on certain aspects (e.g. with regardto how the information on real estate is organised). The report of 2011 willgive more details on this aspect. 

**Legal protection ofGI by intellectual property rights** 

Norway is a member of the Bern Convention. The NorwegianCopyright Act (Act no. 2 of 12 May 1961 relating to copyright in literary,scientific and artistic works) was last amended with the implementation of theEU Directive on harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and relatedrights in the information society by the Act of 9 January 2005 amending theCopyright Act. 

Under the obligations of the EEA (European Economic Area)Treaty, EEA states (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) must also comply withEuropean legislation in the field of intellectual property, such as theDatabase Directive 96/9/EC. Norway, like the rest of the Nordic countries, hadenacted provisions for the protection of non-original and comprehensivedatabases before this Directive was even discussed: in article 43 of theCopyright Act. In 1999 article 43 was somewhat modified to correspond with theDirective. This includes protecting “investments” as well as “largecompilations” and prolonging the protection period from 10 to 15 years. 

Article 43a of the Copyright Act stipulates that a personwho produces a photographic picture shall have the exclusive right to makecopies thereof and to make it available to the public. This exclusive right toa photographic picture shall subsist during the lifetime of the photographerand for 15 years after the expiry of the year in which he died, but for notless than 50 years from the expiry of the year in which the picture wasproduced. This protection is for photographs that are not copyright protectedand therefore particularly interesting for aerial photography. 

**Restricted access toGI further to the legal protection of privacy** 

The 1814 Constitution does not explicitly recognize theright to privacy, although a provision concerning the freedom from searches ofprivate homes in section 102 implies certain privacy rights. The Supreme Courtruled in 1952 that the law recognizes the legal protection of""personality,"" a concept which contains a right to privacy. 

The Personal Data Registers Act of 2000 (Lov no. 31 ombehandling av personopplysninger) was approved on 14 April 2000. It is designedto follow Directive 95/46/EC. It mainly restricts access to spatial informationcontaining detailed information on ownership to properties. 

Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communicationswas implemented in Norway by the Electronic Communications Act of 4 July 2003and the Regulations on Electronic Communications Networks and Services. 

Limitation of access is in general approached in a pragmaticway. In the new cadastral system the owner information is not given. But inreality there are other existing mechanisms through which you can obtain alsovery specific information, e.g. there is an existing service where citizens canSMS to ask for the owner of a car based on the car plate number. The newGeodata Act is not changing anything with this regard. The protection ofpersonal data will also be tackled in the new law on land registration. 

**Licensing framework**

The partners of Norway Digital can use all data that areincluded based on a set of two contracts: the general agreement of NorwayDigital and a specific contract between the partners involved that includes theannual cost, the delivery and specific conditions or limitations. Distributionto commercial companies was organised by a private company, NorskEijendomsinformasjon, but will be taken over by the NMA from 2010 (seepresentation on Norge Digital). 

Currently, the NMA has a pricing policy with two main categories:usage rights for any internal purpose and marketing rights to make the data ora value-added product available to the public. On 1 December 2009, the NMAannounced that it will make on-line access to the maps free for individuals ornon-profit associations for a trial period of six months (seehttp://www.statkart.no/Gratis+karttjenester.d25-SwJfY1-.ips and <http://www.epsiplatform.eu/news/news/norwegian_free_map_services>).

**Funding of SDI andpricing policy** 

Financing comes from government funds, user payment, andjoint ventures with public authorities and public owned organisations. With thenew law (Geodata Act) also new budgets are foreseen. While the NSDI developmentwas still largely voluntary based, the implementation of the new law foresees 2million € for the national level, and 2 million € for the municipalities. Inturn, the municipalities should contribute with data (not own services), whilethe national level is responsible for putting services on top of the(aggregated) data. At the national level the money is meant also for support,including 2 additional people for Monitoring & Reporting. 

With regard to pricing, it is the tradition that governmentinformation is charged for. However, under the new Act implementing the PSIdirective, the starting point should be that public sector bodies deliver theirinformation free of charge. An exception is made for organisations dealing withgeographic data and property information. They are still permitted to chargethe costs of gathering the information and a reasonable return on investment.During the visit in May 2010 it was stated that the fees calculated for theusage of the services of the NSDI should probably be recalculated to bring itmore in line with the principles set out in the PSI Directive. Themodifications in the field of the pricing policy will certainly influence thefunding and might create some financial gaps that should be resolved in one oranother way. There might be also some implications for the partnerships withinthe SDI. The fact that Oslo did not join so far has also to do with the issuesof charging based on “cost recovery” and/or “ROI” models. Although the currentlaw does not directly speak about these issues, the regulation(s) that willfollow will tackle this in on or another way. 

Within the Geovekst forum, each partner contributes to theprojects with funding and personnel. The resulting databases are accessible toall participants for joint use. Under Norway digital, each partner pays anannual fee for the use of the data that has been brought in by all thepartners. A system of partnership fees has been elaborated, called the “DigitalNorway-calculator” which is a flexible pricing mechanism based on the type ofdatasets needed (and related interest factor), base value and other parameters(e.g. the importance of the data set for the users, the intensity of use basedon service requests). 

This mechanism has been agreed upon between the partners ofthe SDI. Towards commercial partners, the information is made available by thegovernment owned company called Norsk Eiendomsinformasjon, which isdistributing all information about land registration on behalf of the government.This company is supposed to have full user payment for its products(www.eiendomsinfo.no). The distribution will be taken over by the NMA from2010. The NMA has also announced in December 2009 that it will start makingsome of its information available free of charge for non-commercial use, in atest phase of six months. Commercial use will remain charged for. As anotherexample of more freely available data, Statistics Norway (www.ssb.no)distributes its information largely free of charge or at most at marginal cost.The same is the case for Norwegian Geologic Survey, Directorate of NatureProtection and Norwegian Soil and Forestry Survey. They have a policy not tocharge for the information, only for the cost to distribute it. Pricing forcadastral information is based on statutory requirements. 

 **Conclusions of component 2: Legal and funding issues** 

Based on the above description we can conclude that Norwaywho decided to implement INSPIRE within the framework of the European EconomicArea cooperation, has a clear vision and strategy, and since 2010 a new GeodataAct which transposes the INSPIRE Directive into national legislation. Also theformer white paper is serving as a baseline for development of the NSDI.Although the private sector plays a role in the development of the NSDI, thespecific tasks might be further clarified and it is not so clear whether theytake the form of PPP’s. There is no specific (new) information availableregarding IPR and FOI. Privacy issues and the treatment of personal data is anissue that receives attention, rather through concrete measures at databaselevel (e.g. filters) than through specific legislation. There is a clear policyregarding sharing between public authorities and also standardized licenses forpersonal use exist now for some time. The sharing policy might be furtherstreamlined in view of the new legislation. Norway has a solid mechanism forfunding its NSDI. Even though the new law, as well as the PSI Directive mightresult in the review of certain practices. A real pricing framework forcommercialising GI is not really in place. 

Based on these conclusions we score the indicators asfollows: 

·There is a legal instrument or framework determining the SDI-strategy or –development (Geodata Act to be approved by the parliament) 

·There are true PPP’s or other co-financing mechanisms between public andprivate sector bodies with respect to the development and operation of the SDIrelated projects (partially) 

·There is a freedom of information (FOI) act which contains specific FOIlegislation for the GI-sector (not scored) 

· GIcan specifically be protected by copyright (not scored) 

·Privacy laws are actively being taken into account by the holders of GI(Partially true) 

·There is a framework or policy for sharing GI between public institutions (Yes)

·There are simplified and standardised licences for personal use (Yes) 

· Thelong-term financial security of the SDI-initiative is secured (Yes) 

·There is a pricing framework for trading, using and/or commercialising GI (No)"					Friday, May 29, 2015	Staff_Consultant	INFO

In improving the administration of land reform and rural development, and transformation as a whole, the department has initiated policy shifts. These will assist in realizing the department’s commitment to taking the land reform and rural development priority mandate of government onto a new trajectory in line with the expectations of the citizens. The following are a few of the legislation pieces that the department has been working on.


**Geomatics Profession Act, Act 19 of 2013**


The Geomatics Profession Bill was passed by the National Assembly on 20 June 2013, and was assented to by the President on 9 December 2013 as Act 19 of 2013. The Act replaces the Professional and Technical Surveyors Act, 40 of 1984，which catered for surveyors but excluded geographical science professionals and mine surveyors. The Act makes provision for all Geomatics professionals, technologists and technicians. Furthermore, it will ensure that the professional council is more representative, while it places more emphasis on education and training, as well as the marketing of the profession to attract more people into it.


**Spatial Data Infrastructure Act, Act 54 of 2003**


The Spatial Data Infrastructure Act provides for the establishment of the South African Spatial Data Infrastructure and the Committee for Spatial Information. The primary purpose is to ensure the open sharing of spatial information among organs of State. The Act is currently under review and a draft Spatial Data Infrastructure Amendment Bill has been prepared and approved by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform for submission to the Cabinet. There has however, been further delays in this process. The amendments relate mainly to clarifying some definitions, making the process of appointing members of the Committee for Spatial Information easier, authorizing the Committee for Spatial Information to make policies and guidelines, and to provide for penalties for non- compliance with the Act, Regulations and official standards. Draft Regulations have also been prepared that will come into operation once the Spatial Data Infrastructure Amendment Bill is enacted. These Regulations are aligned to the Act and the envisaged Amendment Act.


**Deeds Registries Amendment Act, Act 34 of 2013**


The Deeds Registries Amendment Act was assented to by President on 14 December 2013. The Act amends the Deeds Registries Act, 1937. Among other things but not limited to, the Act provides discretion in respect of the rectification of errors in the name of a person or the description of property mentioned in deeds and other documents, the issuing of certificates of registered title taking the place of deeds that have become incomplete or unserviceable. The Act also provides for the substitution of an obsolete reference and an outdated heading. The Act further regulates the updating of deeds in respect of the change of names of companies, close corporations and the surnames of women. **Sectional Titles Amendment Act, Act 33 of 2013**


President Zuma signed the Amendment Act on 18 December 2013. The Act seeks to amend the Sectional Titles Act, Act 95 of 1986. The amendments include among other things but not limited to; the provision for further regulation of notification of the intended establishment of schemes and the sale of units to lessees, allowing for the cancellation of registered sectional plans in a prescribed manner, the cancellation of part of a section pursuant to an expropriation, the registration of a transfer of a part of the common property with the consent of the owners of the sections and the holders of registered real rights, regulation of the issuing of a certificate of registered sectional title in respect of a fraction of an undivided share in a section and the issuing of more than one certificate of real right of extension and more than one certificate of real right of exclusive use area.


**Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, Act 15 of 2014**


The Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, was signed into law by President on 29 June 2014. This historic event builds on other legislative achievements of the department in respect of land reform. The Act amends the Restitution of Land Rights Act, Act no. 22 of 1994 to provide for the re-opening of the land claims process which effectively propels the country forward in the quest to reverse the legacy of the 1913 Land Act. The State has re-opened the lodgment of claims to enable the excluded claimants to lodge claims. The re-opening of land claims will provide an opportunity to persons and communities that did not lodge claims by the cut-off date of 31 December 1998 to also benefit from the restitution programme."			http://ggim.un.org/knowledgebase/Attachment234.aspx?AttachmentType=1	Spatial Data Infrastructure Act (No. 54 of 2003) in South Africa.pdf	Tuesday, July 5, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

In 2006, the Swedish Parliament approved legislation that officially appointed Lantmäteriet as the coordinator for the Swedish NSDI and setup the Geodata Advisory Board. The Swedish Geodata Strategy was adopted as the central strategy document on the development of the Swedish NSDI. The implementation of the Swedish Geodata Strategy and the INSPIRE directive is embedded in other initiatives, such as the government’s e-governance strategy. 8 action areas are identified as separate work packages in the Strategy:


• Co-operation in networks as a basis for the infrastructure, with priority given to the development of models for activities and agreements. The identification of areas of application that have a significant potential.


• The structuring of information, including the development of a basic framework containing descriptions of rules and methods for a service-oriented exchange of information and which describes geodata, defines the geodata sector and takes into account the requirements of the Inspire directive.


• The technical infrastructure, including the establishment of a geodata portal for a development environment, standardised interfaces and a national service catalogue.


• A national metadata catalogue, including a national programme for the creation of metadata.


• Geodetic reference systems and an accelerated transition to the new national reference system, Sweref 99.


• Research and development (R&D) and education including the formulation of a national R&D and education programme.


• Legislation, including an investigation of the possible need for changes and adaptation to Inspire.


• Financing and price-setting, including the development of financing and flexible pricing models and the implementation of cost-benefit analyses.


In the course of 2010, a number of legislative acts were adopted implementing the INSPIRE directive in Swedish law: 


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Sweden K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15


• Act 2010:1767 on geographic environmental information.


• Act 2010:1768 amending Act 2009:400 on public access to information and secrecy;


• Act 2010:1772 amending Act 2000:224 on the Cadastre;


• Ordonnance 2010:1771 amending Ordonnance 2009:946 on the tasks of the National Land Survey;


• Ordonnance 2010:1770 on spatial environmental information.


**Public-private partnerships**


Some private companies (e.g. T-kartor, Liber) are data producers for certain parts of the NSDI and service providers for some forms of geographic information. Thus in Sweden private commercial firms are involved in building the NSDI in different ways. They can be contracted for development works or production works, but also as vendors. Normally, private commercial firms are making “value-added” products out of core data. For instance, Lantmäteriet supports the establishment of value added resellers (VARs). 


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information**


Further to the Nordic tradition of open access to government files, the citizen’s right of access to government documents is seen as a fundamental aspect of Swedish society. It was first introduced in 1766 by a forerunner to the Freedom of the Press Act (FOI legislation) from 1948. The Freedom of the Press Act provides for access to documents kept by a public authority (e.g. the parliament, the government, state agencies and municipalities), including electronic documents. Access to documents is free of charge. The citizen also has a right to get a copy of the document or an extract from an electronic document. The fee for the copy should respond to the cost for producing the copy (marginal cost). There is no obligation to make available records for electronic data processing in any form other than printouts. Access can be denied only with reference to a specific clause in legislation demanding secrecy (the 2009 Secrecy Act). The purpose of request – commercial interests or not – is not relevant. In general private legal entities controlled by the crown with public tasks are not subject to the access regulations contrary to municipal entities, which are under the access regulations.


Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information and Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI have been transposed into Swedish law. The Swedish authorities originally believed that no changes to the legislation were necessary to implement Directive 2003/98. After the European Commission had sent a letter of formal notice to the Swedish government for the incorrect transposition of the PSI directive a new Act has been adopted in July 2010. However, many registers and databases remain subject to separate legislation regulating their re-use, often under cost recovery prices.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Crown claims copyright to GI produced by and for the National Land Survey. The Lantmäteriet administers the copyright on behalf of the Crown. The Crown also claims the database right on GI on real estate registers information in certain cases. The municipalities, the biggest producer of maps in Sweden, also claim copyright and suigeneris protection to their maps and databases.


The current Swedish Copyright Act dates from 1960 (Law no. 729 of 30 December 1960, as last amended in 2009).


Article 49 of the Copyright Act provides for the protection of catalogues, tables or similar products that contain a large amount of items of information. Article 49 also details the sui generis protection for databases. The protection lasts for ten years after initial publication. The protection exists in addition to copyright. In addition to photographs being able to attract copyright (if original), all photographs are protected by an exclusive right of reproduction according to article 49a of the Copyright Act. This right subsists until 50 years after roduction.


Following article 9 of the Copyright Act, laws and other regulations, decisions by public authorities, reports by Swedish public authorities and translations of the aforementioned documents are not subject to copyright. The law specifically states that among others maps and drawings that form part of the documents listed in the first paragraph of article 9 are protected by copyright (if, of course, they meet the general criteria set for copyright  rotection). Although works of public authorities other than those mentioned above may be subject to copyright, there is a general right for everybody to access and get a copy of  them in accordance with the regulations in the Freedom of the Press Act (art. 26a). The documents can normally be used freely but there are a number of exceptions. Works that pertain to geographical information: maps, computer programmes, technical models, works which are the result of scientific research and works that are commercially exploited by public authorities may not be freely used (art. 26§ 3).


The 1993 Act on the Protection of Land Information contains provisions that limit the free production and distribution of certain types of GI. The purpose of this legislation is to regulate and control the use and dissemination of GI from national security-reasons. The production of aerial photographs is with the exception of smaller parts of the country free. Building databases with land information, dissemination of aerial photographs, certain maps and land-information in digital form is subject to approval of the authorities for reasons of national security.


Sweden has transposed the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society in May 2005. 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


On 24 October 1998 the Personal Data Act (1998:204) came into force and replaced the out-dated Swedish Data Act from 1973. The Personal Data Act is based on Directive 95/46/EC. Section 33 of the Act was amended in 1999 to implement the EU Directive on the transfer of personal data to a third country. Data protection applies to a large amount of government information, including the SPAR population database, certain types of statistics, certain types of real property information and geographical information (addresses, real estate unit umber), vehicle registries and VAT files. Sweden has transposed the 2002 directive on privacy and electronic communications into national law.


**Licensing framework**


The pricing model for fundamental geographic data is based on decisions by Parliament and Government. The board of Lantmäteriet decides its own framework for pricing and licensing, based on the overall model and economic targets decided by Government. Läntmateriet does not provide data directly to the users, but through resellers. However an increasing number of services are also directly available on Lantmäteriet’s website. The viewing services are free of charge, but downloading data is charged for. Data can only be bought for private use. For any other type of use, the customer service has to be contacted. Under the National Geodata Strategy, a licensing strategy was developed that makes a distinction between different users and types of use. This should be incorporated in the development of a business model. Public bodies participating in INSPIRE are subject to general terms and conditions and pay an annual fee that is defined in advance based on number of agreed parameters. Any other data providers and users should buy licences for a particular volume of data, a specific type of ata or a specific service. Developers of added-value products should purchase a refiner licence. They have to ensure that all end users have a licence before the launch of any new products, or purchase a licence through which the end user fee is paid in advance. Special conditions will apply for research and education, and for access by the general public."					Thursday, September 1, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The Infrastructure for Spatial Information Act was adopted by the Parliament in December 2008 and entered into force on 15 May 2009. The Act sets the framework for the further  evelopment of the Danish SDI. KMS is now assigned to manage the infrastructure for spatial information in Denmark. The Act contains two additions to the provisions stemming from the INSPIRE directive. Firstly, the Danish minister for the Environment can extend the scope of the Act to data outside of the Annexes of the INSPIRE directive, after negotiations with the minister responsible for these data.


Secondly, the Minister can also determine, in collaboration with other public sector parties, which data should be used as the foundation and the official sources for mapping and registration (KMS, Infrastructure for spatial data in Denmark 2009.


Also in 2009, agreements for the use of spatial data were concluded with central government (National Geodata Agreement) and with all municipalities (Municipal Geodata Agreement). These agreements took effect from 2010.


The Danish policy on spatial data infrastructures is closely linked to the eGovernment policy. The rules and guidelines for spatial data should help increase their value for eGovernment policy.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The Danish SDI has a history of successful public-private cooperation. For instance, the digital national topographic database TOP10DK was created as a PPP in 2000; and the digitization of the Cadastre in the 1990s took place in cooperation between the public and the private sector.


Cooperation between the public and the private sector is considered very important for the development of the Danish NSDI. The public bodies specify the data requirements, conduct data quality assurance and distribute the data. The private companies collect the data and contribute technical solutions for accessibility (Jesper Jarmbæk, The Danish Way: Development of the Danish Spatial Data Infrastructure through Binding Collaboration, 


<http://www.gsdi.org/gsdi11/papers/pdf/179.pdf>）


 


KMS offers maps and data via an API called Map Supply

The Cadastre has formed partnerships with a number of companies that develop applications for users.

**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The general right of access to government held information is laid down in Act no. 572 of 19 December 1985 on Access to Public Administration Files (Lov om offentlighed i forvaltningen). Public administration in the sense of this Act means all public bodies of central and local government, excluding Parliament and the Courts. Utility companies are also subject to the Access Act, but other private sector companies with public tasks generally are not. There are various grounds for denying access, for instance confidentiality of the files in question and privacy. More important, access may be limited out of consideration for public financial interests, which includes the interest of public sector bodies that undertake activities of a commercial nature.


Directive 2003/4 and the provisions of the Aarhus Convention have been included in the Access to Environmental Information Act.. Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI has been implemented by Law no. 596 of 24 June 2005. The Law was amended by Act no. 551 of 17 June 2008, which entered into force on 1 July 2008. The amendment widened the law and included Parliamentary and Court .


In June 2008, this analysis prompted the government’s economic committee to pass a new agreement on financing central government authorities’ access to geodata and services from the National Survey and Cadastre. The new framework took effect at January 1, 2009. This agreement grants all ministries full access to geodata and relevant services from the National Survey and Cadastre. Rather than paying traditional usage fees, each ministry will pay a fixed annual contribution based on its use and needs. The agreement underlines the National Survey and Cadastre’s role as the central government’s infrastructure organisation for maps and geodata. The framework provides all ministries and agencies, universities and  lementary- and secondary- schools and with access to the majority of the Cadastre’s geodata holdings, as well as access to these geodata over the Internet through the Digital Map Supply.


The main provisions:


 The whole of central government will have access to data from the National Survey and Cadastre, increasing the data’s value.


 Whole of central government will help finance the data’s maintenance.


 Each ministry’s payment is fixed according to its estimated geodata benefit, and the payment encompasses all institutions within the ministry.


 The central government’s procurement of geodata will be better coordinated. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Denmark K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16


Elements covered by the agreement:


 Topographical data collections


 Reference network data


 The Danish Digital Elevation Model


 Property register maps and data


 Nautical chart data


 Web services for retrieving and displaying geodata, including the Digital Map Supply In a similar agreement between the local authorities and KMS, municipalities have since 2010 free access to a range of major spatial data and spatial data services from the National Survey and Cadastre. Under the 2002 agreement on ‘Better access to public data’, the Building and Dwelling Register (BBR) address data are made available to public and private users, including for commercial purposes at the cost of distribution only. The objective of the agreement was to establish a broad and intensive use of the official Danish address data in both the public and private sector. The BBR address data are made available as a download service through the Public Information Server (OIS) and as an online network service using Address Web Services (AWS). The latter is offered by the Ministry of Economics and  usiness Affairs in cooperation with KMS, which makes the spatial AWS services available as SOAP and Web Map Services (WMS).


The Danish Nature and Environment Portal is a joint public-sector partnership between the Ministry of the Environment, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions. The aim is to support the environmental public bodies to fulfil their responsibilities, ensure a uniform and updated core of environmental data, promote digital procedures in the environmental area and strengthen communication with the public.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Copyright Act became effective as of 1 January 1996. This Act consolidated and systematically modernised Danish copyright legislation, replacing the old Copyright Act from 1961. The main Act (Act no. 395 of 14 June 1995) has already been amended several times (Act no. 295 of 24 April 1996 and Act no. 1207 of 27 December 1996). The EU atabase Directive was incorporated into the Danish Copyright Act by Act no. 407 of 26 June 1998. The current provisions are now found in Consolidated Act no. 706 of 29 September 1998.


Section 9 of the Copyright Act provides that laws, administrative orders, legal decisions and similar official documents are not subject to copyright. This exemption does not extend to works appearing as independent contributions in the documents (e.g. a EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Denmark K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 copyrighted map that is part of an administrative decision on urban development).


Although these works may be copied together with the rest of the document that is not subject to copyright, in further exploitation the rights of the copyright owner must be respected.There is a special situation about old topographic maps, where KMS has a time unlimited copyright.


Until 1995, photographs were protected by the Photography Act. This Act has been repealed and the protection of photographs has been incorporated into the Copyright Act. A photograph may enjoy protection either as an actual copyrighted work or as a photographic picture. The difference lies both in the material provisions on legal protection and in the timeframe. The right to a photographic picture lasts 50 years from the end of the year in which the picture was taken, whereas a copyrighted work enjoys protection for 70 years after the year of the author's death. All objects made by the aid of the reaction of light-sensitive material shall be considered as a photographic picture. Denmark has implemented the 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Directive 95/46/EC was implemented into Danish legislation by the Act on the Processing of Personal Data (Act no. 429) of 31 May 2000 (Lov om behandling af personoplysninger), which entered into force on 1 July 2000. This Act substitutes the Public Authorities' Registers Act and the Private Registers Act, both of which became law on 1 January 1979. The Danish Data Protection Agency exercises surveillance over processing of data to which the Act applies. Denmark has implemented Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications with a framework of regulations. 


 


**Licensing framework**


Data from KMS is accessible to the public via Digital Map Supply. For downloading purposes, the KMS website makes a distinction between professional users and other users. For the former, several products are delivered via web-services, online services, CD-ROM, DVD and photocopies. Other users are referred to resellers of paper maps. In 2009 and 2010, agreements were concluded between KMS and the central government and between KMS and the municipalities. Under the National Geodata Agreement, all ministries, agencies, universities and elementary and secondary schools get access to KMS data, such as topographic data, reference network data, DEM, cadastral data and nautical charts. They get access to the web services and Digital Map Supply. A  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Denmark K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 coordination forum is established to manage the Agreement (Jesper Jarmbæk, The Danish Way: Development of the Danish Spatial Data Infrastructure through Binding Collaboration, http://www.gsdi.org/gsdi11/papers/pdf/179.pdf). Under the Municipal Geodata Agreement, the local authorities obtain access to the data and web services of KMS. KMS also has agreements with the Armed Forces and the regions. In January, the National Geodata Agreement came into effect, and all ministries gained access to the National Survey and Cadastre’s geodata and web services. A similar Municipal Geodata Agreement was reached with Local Government Denmark in 2009, and will come into effect in 2010. The National Survey and Cadastre and the Armed Forces have an existing agreement on geodata and web services access; the country’s five regions have also inherited the geodata access agreements that were held by the former counties. This agreement supported an increased interest in the application of spatial data to new areas including health, environment, defence and mergency management.


Meanwhile, municipalities continue joining a number of collaborative efforts. These include the development of unified nationwide topographic data through FOT Denmark and the acquisition of the Danish Digital Elevation Model, which was produced and quality-controlled in accordance with official requirements. The Danish Digital Elevation Model was purchased in 2007 with user rights for all central government bodies and is today one of the services which may be accessed under the National Geodata Agreement. At the end of 2010, also 89 of the country’s 98 municipalities had obtained user rights for the Danish Digital Elevation Model."					Thursday, June 9, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

MinVROM is the formal responsible for GI-related matters in The Netherlands. The results of the NSDI-initiative are partially integrated in legal instruments:


A key element of the NSDI is the “authentic registers”. Authentic registrations are registrations with a uniquely defined core dataset, which government agencies are obligated to use. The collection and maintenance of the data is regulated in legislation, the data certified as accurate and current, and the producer assumes all liability for its use by others. Access to data in authentic registers should be conformal the guidelines presented in the memorandum towards accessible government (transparency on data policy). Its users are obliged to report incorrect information to producers, and there is a stringent policy on quality assurance. 


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The etherlands


K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20


The authentic registrations include several datasets that can be considered as geographic datasets.


 First, the law making Top10NL of the Cadastre the authentic registration for topography was adopted in January 2008 by amendments to the Law on the Cadastre. From 1 January 2009, all public bodies in the Netherlands are under an obligation to use it. Local authorities that had their own 1:10.000 topographic maps had to make the switch by 1 January 2010. In addition, the derived 1:50.000, 1:100.000, 1:250.000, 1:500.000 and 1:1.000.000 are also part of the authentic registration for topography. A convenant was signed between the Ministry of VROM and the Cadastre about the maintenance of the registration.


Second, the authentic registration for addresses and buildings was included in the law of 24 January 2008 (which was amended on 14 February 2009). The law entered into force on 1 July 2009, and the local authorities are since then under the obligation to deliver their address and building data to the national registry. From 1 July 2011, the registration has to be used by all public bodies. For the third authentic registration, the large-scale topography (1:500 to 1:5.000), draft legislation was intended to be issued in early 2010. The fourth authentic registration, subsurface, will be fully operational by 2013. This was approved by a Decision from the cabinet in December 2008. Another important legal instrument is the law 2 July 2009 transposing the INSPIRE directive into Dutch law. The law stays close to the directive, requires the public authorities to create metadata and gives everyone the right to use the network services. The rules for sharing data have to be set up by a ministerial decree.


**Public-private partnerships (PPP’s)**


In 1975, by Royal Degree, the Large Scale Base Map of the Netherlands (GBKN -Grootschalige Basiskaart van Nederland) was established. After a long period of development, in 1992 the LSV-GBKN (Landelijk Samenwerkingverband – National Cooperation GBKN) was established which finished the production of the GBKN in 1999. The LSV-GBKN was a national joint venture with 11 regional joint ventures. The production costs are €20 million and nationwide fully covered. It is a PPP of the municipalities, utility companies, water boards, the Dutch Cadastre and the Dutch administration. After the GBKN moves to the authentic registration large scale topography, the maintenance will be a public task and the PPP construction will no longer be maintained. Between 2001 and 2007, the private company Geodan had taken over the exploitation and the management of the NCGI. From 2007 onwards, the NGCI was replaced by GEONOVUM. 


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The Netherlands


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


The legal basis for access to public information is the Government Information Public Access Act of 31 October 1991. This act replaced the Act on Public Access to Information of 9 November 1978. It creates a presumption that documents created by a public agency should be available to everyone. The law provides for access to information that is crucial in the decision making process of the administration. The price to be paid for this information is based on dissemination cost. It is reasoned however that the electronic geographic data cannot be obtained through a request based on this Act. Government agencies can claim copyright or database right on their data and most of them do so. Moreover, citizens or businesses cannot access entire databases because -according to current interpretation- the Government Information Act does not apply to complete databases.


Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information was implemented in Dutch law by the Act of 30 September 2004, modifying the Government Information Public Access Act, the Act on environmental management and other Acts. The Government Information Public Access Act has been revised to include the implementation of Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI. In 2009, the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced that it would review the legislation implementing the PSI directive. While the Dutch policy already went beyond the minimum requirements of the directive (thanks to the policy document ‘Naar de optimal beschikbaarheid van overheidsinformatie – Towards the optimal availability of public sector information), this will be translated into the legislation. The new legislation is intended to be brought before Parliament before the end of 2010. Its main principles are: the adaptation of the pricing principle towards the charging of only marginal costs; the banning of public sector bodies to use their intellectual property rights to impose conditions on re-use; and the creation of transitory rules for a number of data collections, including the Cadastre, allowing for the adaptation of their funding model.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Copyright is primarily regulated by the Copyright Act of 1912. The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society has been included into national legislation. In principle, copyright is applicable to all government information -with the exception of official texts of legislation, judicial decisions and administrative decrees-, although copyright must be claimed explicitly by the government for the protection to be effective and a copyright sign (©) has to be placed on the work. Commercial use of the data for which copyright is claimed by an administrative agency is only allowed when the agency concerned gives its consent. Due to their factual and standardized character geographic information often does not meet the requirements of originality required by copyright. However, common law shows that geo-information with a personal view can still be protected by copyright.  


EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The Netherlands 


Based on the European Directive on the legal protection of databases (96/9/EC), the 1912 Copyright Act was amended and a Dutch version of the Directive, the Database Law, enacted in 1999. The new law protects the producer of a database which shows that there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents. Government agencies explicitly have to reserve their rights. In a Decision on a case between the City of Amsterdam and Landmark, the Council of State (the highest administrative court) decided that the city could not be considered a producer of the database, because it did not bear the risk of the substantial investment in the database, as the data was partially obtained from the national ministry, and partially paid for by the city of Amsterdam in order to facilitate the performance of its public task. The court found that there was no financial risk, so the city could not invoke its database right to impose conditions on the re-use by Landmark. The new legislation on PSI will ban the public sector bodies from using their intellectual property rights to restrict the re-use of their data.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Netherlands Data Registration Act was passed in 1989 and applies to all collections of personal data, regardless of residency status in the Netherlands. It also applies to foreign files having a Dutch file controller and containing personal data about Netherlands residents. A new Personal Data Protection Act (Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens – WBP) was approved by the parliament in June 2000 and implements EU Directive 95/46/EG. It came into force on 1 September 2001. Although geographic data primarily focuses on geographic objects and not on natural persons, and even might be presented in an anonymous way, an operator can often easily relate these data to natural persons. In most cases the law oncerning privacy protection is therefore applicable to geo-information. Hence, each organization or business should notify persons that they have been registered and for what purpose. 


Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been implemented in national law by several regulations and an act of 22 April 2004 in particular. For an overview of the acts implementing this directive, see <http://europa.eu.int/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/implementation_enforcement/country_by_country/netherlands_2002_58.pdf>.


Particular attention to privacy and personal data is also paid in the legislation on the authentic registration for buildings and addresses. Data from the registration that can be considered as personal data can only be transferred to parties that are authorised to process personal data under the privacy legislation.


**Licensing framework**


GEONOVUM, in cooperation with T.U.Delft, has started working on a licensing model based on creative commons, called Geo gedeeld. It proposes four sets of standard EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 The Netherlands K.U.Leuven (SADL) 23 licensing conditions. All licences contain an obligation of attribution, and may contain one or more of the following conditions: 


 Permission is required to make the data available to third parties or to create derived products; The licence has a limited duration;  A charge has to be paid for using the data. The model was discussed with the data holders and adapted to their needs. It will be implemented in the course of 2010."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The main legal instruments on the federal level include the federal law on access to geographic data (Gesetz über den Zugang zu digitalen Geodaten -Geodatenzugangsgesetz – GeoZG) and the Administration Agreement, signed by the federal government and all the Länder. The Geodatenzugangsgesetz, which implements INSPIRE for the federal level, was published in 2008 and entered into force in February 2009. The Act creates a legal framework to access spatial data, spatial data services and metadata from the federal geodata holders, primarily aimed at environmental protection (M. Badowski, EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Germany K. U. Leuven (SADL) 24 Implementation of the INSPIRE-Directive in Germany and Poland – Legal Point of View). The laws of the 16 Länder are very alike the federal law, based on a common strategy for the transposition and a common template for the law that was agreed on by all Länder and the federal state. Nine Länder have already adopted their legislation, with the other seven to follow in 2010.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Within the context of INSPIRE implementation the German SDI (GDI-DE) is opened for third parties: As long as they accept the underlying principles of GDI-DE and the regulations of GeoZG third parties may contribute their geo data and metadata using the geoportal of GDI-DE. They just have to ensure the compliance with the technical rules defined by the GeoZG, the INSPIRE implementing rules and the GDI-DE Architecture. In that respect the work of the INSPIRE Task Force can be seen as an example of a PPP. Representatives of the government, scientific institutions and enterprises cooperate to coordinate the outcome of European and national legislation with the technical development within GDI-DE. Establishment of GDI-DE itself is done with major participation of the ""Commission of Geo-Information Industry"" on the conceptual level.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The Federation implemented the European Directive 2003/98/EG on PSI into national law in 2006 by adopting the ""Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz"" (IWG – reuse of public sector information). The IWG regulates the Federal as well as the Federal state and municipal administrative level. Furthermore the Federation in September 2005 adopted the ""Informationsfreiheitsgesetz"" (IFG – free access to public information)"", granting each person an unconditional right to access official federal information. ‘Freedom of information laws’ have been adopted at the regional level by some of the Länder. In Brandenburg the right to freedom of information was explicitly laid down in legislation (constitution) in 1998. It relates to the right of all citizens to access public records held by state authorities, districts and cities, unless public or private interests prevail. Berlin, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, MecklenburgVorpommern, Hamburg, Bremen, Saarland and Thüringen have also recently adopted freedom of information laws. Other federal states are still preparing their FOI laws. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been implemented by the German Environmental Information Law (Umweltinformationsgesetz - UIG), which passed the German Parliament on 22nd of December 2004. UIG defines the facilities which are affected, describes the access to environmental as well as rejection of access, active dissemination of environmental information and fees. It has entered into force on 14 February 2005. The main instrument to support access to environmental information is

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


In Germany the national legislator is competent to issue copyright regulation and other intellectual property laws. The federal states are not allowed to issue state laws that contradict national laws. The German Copyright Act (Urheberrechtgesetz – UrhG) explicitly states that works of literature, science or art have to be original to enjoy copyright protection. Since products of geographical information are functional, their level of originality tends to be rather low. Works with a low level of originality such as geographic maps, tables and so on enjoy copyright protection if some creativity has come into play, for instance in the generalisation process that is inherent in map production, or in the selection and arrangement of data. However, if the level of originality is low, protection granted is similarly low. Photographic works that are original are covered by common copyright. The German Copyright Act however has a special clause that gives the creator of a non-original photograph a right to resist duplication (art. 72 UrhG). The Directives 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases and 91/250/EC on the legal protection of computer programs have been fully integrated in German Copyright Act.


According to article 5 of the Copyright Act, government information is not subject to copyright. Government information is divided into two categories. One category encompasses laws, decrees and so on (article 5(1)), whereas another category deals with official works published in the official interest for public information (article 5(2)). Interpretation of this last article is however very strict since – according to the Supreme Court – it only applies to information that is meant to be made generally available and copied.


The different federal states laws that regulate the work of the surveying and mapping authorities contain clauses that regulate the use of information collected or produced by them. The 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society was transposed by the Gesetzzur Regelung des Urheberrechts in der Informationsgesellschaft of 10 September 2003.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Protection of privacy has a long tradition in Germany and is considered tantamount to a human right. Hence privacy and personal data laws in Germany are generally very restrictive. Spatial datasets that contain information on individuals are in principle subject to the German laws on the protection of privacy. To ensure protection of privacy when implementing the INSPIRE-Directive, the Federal commissioner for data protection was involved when drafting GeoZG. The Federal Data Protection Act of 20 December 1990 Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) – as already amended by the law of 14 September 1994 – was later amended by the Federal Data Protection Act of 18 May 2001. This latest act implements Directive 95/46/EC and came into force on 23 May 2001. The Federal Data Protection Act applies to the federal public sector and the private sector. All federal states (except Sachsen and Bremen) adopted new Data Protection Laws to implement the EU Directive. These acts apply to the public sector of the respective federal states.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Germany K. U. Leuven (SADL) 26 A particularity of German data protection law lies in the fact that in addition to the above Federal Data Protection Act there are numerous sector-specific provisions. All these rules are granting the data subject a variety of possibilities aiming at the respect of his individual data protection rights. The use of (public) geodata is also restricted by the cadastral laws at the federal state level. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communication has been transposed in German law.


**Licensing framework**


Each German authority or agency currently defines its own data policy on a case-by-case basis under the direction of the appropriate Minister. The GDI-DE Steering Committee, GIW-Commission, IMAGI, DDGI and AdV are all – directly or indirectly – working towards the development of a harmonised and simplified licensing framework for GI. A framework to get comparable prices for geo data was adopted by IMAGI in 2006, (see 2.3.7). One of the tasks of AdV is also to deliberate on the costs. These bodies thus have a mission in eveloping a pricing policy for GI.


A good example for simplifying licensing processes is the contract between the Federal states and the Federal Ministry for Interior to provide reference datasets from the federal states to the Federal Administration. It regulates an annual all-inclusive payment from federation to the federal states, which enables the BKG to provide all topographic data sets and services to Federal Agencies for free. In order to further coordinate and simplify the licensing policies for geographic data, the GDI-DE is currently working on licensing templates for spatial data sets and services, aiming at the gradual harmonisation of licences. The provision of licences via standardised web services is in preparation."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The Surveying Act and the Metrology Act form the legal basis for the activities of the BEV as a federal agency. The emphasis of the Acts is on cadastral activities. The coordinating role BEV is playing for the federal NSDI-initiatives has no formal legal basis but is the result of a within-government  greement. In July 2005, a Decree was issued implementing a central Address Registry (Addressregisterverordnung). The Decree organizes the technical aspects, the competences and rights of use and the division of costs between the federal level (BEV) and the municipalities. The municipality is the official “owner” of the data, while the BEV handles the administration and the distribution. For this, the BEV receives about 10% of the revenues .


The Federal Environmental Agency was founded as a separate state-owned corporation by the Umwelkontrollgesetz, which lays out its responsibilities and entered into force on January 1st, 1999. The Austrian government’s approach is to implement INSPIRE:


 (i) without modification of any competencies and responsibilities between federal government (“Bund”) and provincial governments (“Länder”);


 (ii) to stay with the decentralized data ownership and distribution; and


 (iii) to implement only what is strictly legally required (“no golden plating”). ` The current situation is that a federal implementation law was adopted by the Austrian  Parliament and is in force, 5 of the 9 Provinces have an SDI legislative act in force and 2 Provinces have it published. In March 2010, the Geodateninfrastrukturgesetz – GeoDIG was published in the Federal Law Gazette I No. 14/2010, transposing the INSPIRE directive. It entered into force on 2 March.

**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The project flood risk identification HORA in Austria (www.hora.gv.at) is the result of collaboration between the ‘Lebensministerium’and the private sector: Life Assurance Association Austria. It is a nationwide Risk Identification System for natural disasters with the current focus on earthquakes and flooding. The project of a cooperation between public and private sector covers more than 25.000 river miles in 4 years costing about two million euros. HORA meets the requirements set by the European Commission in 2006, Directive on the assessment and management of floods requiring flood risk mapping, predictive assessment methods for flood risks, information and public participation and implementation and reporting schedules.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


Article 20 of the Federal Constitution obliges the federal, provincial and municipal administration to give information on matters relating to their scope of activity, unless they are under a legal duty to maintain secrecy. This obligation is made operational by federal and provincial legislation. The Auskunftspflichtgesetz is a Freedom of Information law that obliges federal authorities to answer questions regarding their areas of responsibility. However, it does not permit citizens to access documents, just to receive answers from the government on the content of information. If an interest can be shown, then the individual requesting information can obtain copies of the documents under the Code of  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe State of play Spring 2011 Austria K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 Administrative Procedures or the Data Protection Act. The nine Austrian Provinces have laws that place similar obligations on their authorities. 


As far as environmental information is concerned, the Federal Law on Environmental Information adopted in 1993 implements the European Union Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment for information held by the federal government. It was amended to implement Directive 2003/4 in the course of 2004-2005 (Bundesgesetz über den Zugang zu Informationen über die Umwelt Umweltinformationsgesetz – UIG, BGBI. Nr. 495/1993 as amended BGBI. I Nr. 6/2005. The changes entered into force in February 2005. By decree of the Austrian Federal Minister of Economic Affairs of 24 June 1997 everybody is granted direct access to the cadastre and the land registry database via the public services of Telekom Austria AG, Datakom Austria AG, IBM Network Services and Bundesrechenzentrum GmbH. Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information has been transposed on the federal level and in the Länder. At the same time as the introduction of the federal legislation on re-use (Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz), the Surveying Act (Vermessungsgesetz) was changed. The new §48 concerns the delivery of geodata and their use for other purposes. In accordance with this act, BEV has introduced new conditions on standard charges and use of the data on 1 January 2006. These general conditions can be downloaded from

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Austrian Copyright Act (Urheberrechtsgesetz) dates from 9 April 1936 and has been amended several times since then. Paragraphs 73 to 76 of the Copyright Act provide for special protection for photographs. Whilst original photographs are subject to normal copyright regulation, all non-original photographs are also protected for thirty years after production or publication. Paragraph 7 of the Copyright Act stipulates that laws, decrees, judicial decisions and the like are not subject to copyright. In addition, all works of public entities produced exclusively or mainly for official use, cannot be subject to copyright. The latter provision should however be interpreted restrictively.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe State of play Spring 2011 Austria K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 Paragraph 7 of the Copyright Act also explicitly states that topographic works produced by the Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen can be subject to copyright. This is the case if they are original, destined for publication, and produced by the Bundesamt. Austria was one of the four countries that managed to implement European Directive 96/9/EC concerning the legal protection of databases in time, i.e. by 1 January 1998. The most recent amendment dates from 2003 and adapts the Copyright Act to the 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Austrian Data Protection Act (called Datenschutzgesetz) was enacted in 1978, creating the Data Protection Commission and the Data Protection Council. It is concerned with all personal data, but does not specifically recognise the concept of “sensitive” data. However, personal information may not be sold and public authorities are required to institute a system of control and sanction for infractions.There were however a number of differences between the Austrian DP Act and the European Directive, but these were for the most part addressed by the Austrian Federal Chancellery in a bill presented to Parliament in 1999, which was passed into law with effect from 1 January 2000. This Bundesgesetz über den Schutz personenbezogener Daten (Datenschutzgesetz 2000) applies to all processing by automatic means. Seven Länder have also adopted new data protection laws to implement the Directive. The Austrian legislation is fully compliant with Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications.


**Licencing framework**


A licensing framework is in use for BEV products. Since 2008, almost all products are available on-line on the BEV portal. A distinction is made between different shops (see <http://www.bev.gv.at/portal/page?_pageid=713,1576213&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL>


 


 BEV Shop Light: the user does not have to register for this and he can anonymously obtain access to Austrian Map Fly 5.0 and national maps  BEV Shop: without registration, the user can search and order predefined products, such as Orthophotography or 1:1.000.000 vector maps.  BEV Shop Plus: the user has to register to obtain further means to search data.

Before the development of the UK Location Strategy, no encompassing policy on the coordination of the provision and dissemination of GI existed at the level of central government. A legal framework for the NSDI in the UK was not developed. The Location Strategy is the general strategic document on which the set-up and implementation of the UK NSDI is based. As a part of the Location Strategy, the INSPIRE directive was transposed by the INSPIRE regulations in December 2009. The final text has been published at


<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2009/uksi_20093157_en_1>


 The development of the legal text was preceded by a consultation on the policy principles on which the regulations were based. The consultation showed the need for a further assessment of the costs and benefits, and a need for communication and guidance (see Explanatory Memorandum to the INSPIRE Regulations 2009). Sub-national legislation also exists for Scotland. 


 


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


An important ‘flagship’ project with respect to public-private partnership in the GI-sector is lead by the National Land Information Service (http://www.nlis.org.uk ). This project is providing a service through which it is now possible to search for property details online. The National Land and Property Gazetteer can also be considered as a form of PPP. This is the national address list that has to be updated by the local authorities in England and Wales. The NLPG is a partnership between Local Government Information House, the Improvement and Development Agency, Intelligent Addressing and Local Government Association. General statements about PPP related to GI have not been found.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The UK Parliament broadly signalled its position with regard to the accessibility of public sector information by passing a Freedom of Information Act in 2000, which came into full force in January 2005. The Act has received considerable criticism from many politicians across the political spectrum and NGOs as being insufficient and weaker than the existing code of practice. In June 2002, the Scottish Parliament approved a Freedom of Information bill that is regarded as stronger than the English Freedom of Information Act. It also will not go into effect until 2005. Free access by the citizen to information on EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 United Kingdom K.U.Leuven (SADL) 14 the environment has however been specified since 1992 by a Statutory Instrument, which was replaced by new Regulations in January 2005. The Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2005 (Statutory Instrument 2005 No. 1515), transposing Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI came into force on 1 July 2005. The regulations do not impose a general obligation on the public sector bodies to make their documents available for re-use. A public sector body may permit re-use, and if it decides to do so, it has to comply with the regulations. The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI), which has a regulatory function for PSI holders has merged with The National Archives with effect from October 2006. The merger created a stronger centre for information management in the public sector, enabling a more responsive approach to the challenges of new technology. The combined organisation will be known as The National Archives, which will continue to operate as a government department and as an executive agency of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs ([http://www.opsi.gov.uk](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/)). 


A number of studies have been done in the UK to show the value of availability of public sector data under non-restrictive conditions and at a charge of marginal costs or lower (e.g. the Office of Fair Trading’s report on Commercial Use of Public Information, the Power of Information Report, the Cambridge Report on Models of Public Sector Information Provision via Trading Funds). These studies paved the way for initiatives of the Office of Public Sector Information and other public bodies to start opening up data. In June 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown enlisted Sir Tim Berners-Lee to help move the British public sector towards opening up its data (Cabinet Office 2009). Following this initiative, the data.gov.uk website was launched in January 2010, with currently over 3,000 datasets that are available for re-use, free of charge and without use restrictions. During 2010, the Public Sector Transparency Board was established by the Prime Minister with the objective to drive forward the Government’s Transparency Agenda and promoting the opening up of government data.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Part I on copyright of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 extends to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It came into force on 1 August 1989. Chapter X of Part I of this Act has some special provisions on Crown and Parliamentary copyright. This 1988 Act provided a major updating of copyright law but the process has continued since then with a number of amendments. EU Directive 96/9/EC of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases was implemented by the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulation 1997, coming into force on 1 January 1998. The Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992 came into force on 1ste January 1993. Both Regulations made amendments to the above Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The amendments to the Copyright Act that transposed the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society into English law came into force on October 31st, 2003. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 United Kingdom K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 In the UK, government geo-information is strongly protected by far reaching Crown copyright. No other country has a system quite like it. Crown copyright is defined in the above Act as a work made by Her Majesty or by an officer or servant of the Crown in the course of his duties. It covers a wide range of material, including legislation, government codes of practice, Ordnance Survey mapping, government reports, official press releases, government forms and many public records. There are however public sector copyright owners other than the Crown, such as local authorities and non-departmental public bodies (NDPB). These are thus not subject to Crown copyright control. The UK system of Crown copyright does however apply to Ordnance Survey  [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/)


which holds a strong market position as far as geographic products is concerned. It is responsible for mapping at all the scales. The Ordnance Survey therefore exercises a virtual monopoly in the provision of mapping through the enforcement of Crown copyright.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Parliament approved the Data Protection Act in July 1998, which came into force on 1 March 2000. This Act updates the 1984 Data Protection Act in accordance with the requirements of the EU Directive 95/46/EC. The 1998 Act covers records held by government agencies and private entities. It provides for limitations on the use of personal information, access to and correction of records and requires that entities that maintain records, register with the Information Commissioner [http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk](http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/)


The Office of the Information Commissioner is an independent agency that maintains the register and enforces the Act. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into English law.


**Licensing framework**


Public sector information regulated by Crown Copyright is licensed by the Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) at The National Archives (TNA) but for many geographic datasets, the data providers have their own licensing policy, e.g. Ordnance Survey, British Geological Survey,  nvironment Agency, and Met Office. However, TNA works with these agencies (and with local authorities and other public bodies) to harmonise licensing policies, by giving advice, providing guidelines and by managing the Information Fair Trader Scheme. The Information Fair Trader Scheme (IFTS) ensures that re-users of public sector information can be confident that they will be treated reasonably and fairly by public sector information providers. All Crown bodies that have a licensing delegation from the Controller of OPSI (such as Ordnance Survey) must join the Scheme, but it is open to public sector organisations to join voluntarily. Public bodies that are accredited under the scheme include Ordnance Survey, Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland, British Geological Survey, Registers of Scotland and the UK Hydrographic Office.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 United Kingdom K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 In June 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown enlisted Sir Tim Berners-Lee to help move the British public sector towards opening up its data (Cabinet Office 2009). Following this initiative, the data.gov.uk website was launched in January 2010, with currently over 3,000 datasets that are available for re-use, free of charge and without use restrictions under the Open Government Licence. The only conditions involve attribution (see


<http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-governmentlicence/opengovernmentlicence.htm>


 


The UK Location Data Sharing Operational Guidance establishes the UK Government Licensing Framework as the basis for licensing the use of datasets that are part of UK Location. When the location data is available without further restrictions, conditions or charges, the Open Government Licence will be used as the default licence. For other data, new licence models are being developed. (UK Location, UK Location Data Sharing Operational Guidance Part 2 – Licensing and Charging, <http://location.defra.gov.uk/2011/03/data-sharing-operational-guidance/>


 


In March 2010, Ordnance Survey decided to make some of its datasets openly available under the OS Open Data Licence, using the same licence terms as the data.gov.uk website. See <http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1529556>


 Since November 2010, a new licensing and pricing model was launched for the Ordnance Survey data that was not subject to the OS Open Data Licence (see


<http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/business/licences/2010-model.html>


 


Next to its regular licensing policies, Ordnance Survey also has a number of Collective Licensing Agreements, for instance with the National Health Service, and with central bodies under the Pan-Government Agreements. Since April 2009, Ordnance Survey and Landmark have launched a new version of the Pan-Government Agreement for 4 years, providing national bodies with access to a broader set of data at an affordable price (see

The main legal provisions with regard to Brussels UrbIS can be found in two decisions of the government of the Brussels Region. The Decision of 19 May 1994 charges the CIBG with all assignments regarding the promotion, distribution and service provision of Brussels UrbIS. The Decision of 4 July 1996 determines the pricing of the services that are offered by Brussels UrbIS. In the same decision, the CIBG is charged with a number of assignments and services, such as the dissemination under licence constraints of Brussels UrbIS and the realisation of cartography activities. Next to adopting the cooperation agreement with regard to INSPIRE mentioned earlier, the Brussels Region also transposed the INSPIRE directive within its own jurisdiction in October 2010. The Ordnance regarding spatial data in the Brussels Region was published and entered into force in November 2010.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Seven utility companies participate in and co-finance Brussels UrbIS. No other recent information on existing PPPs was found.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


In Belgium, the federal level and all regions have to transpose the INSPIRE directive with regard to the data sets and services for which they are competent. For particular aspects regarding coordination and cooperation, the federal level and the regions have concluded a cooperation agreement. The objective of the agreement is the setting up and safeguarding of the application of the general rules of coordination between the different parties in order to enable the compliance with the obligations of the INSPIRE directive and to realise the Belgian contribution to the development of the INSPIRE infrastructure. This agreement installs the INSPIRE Coordination Committee, composed of 2 representatives from each region and the Federal state, the Member State Contact Point, the Belgian representative in the Comitology procedure and the president of the Belgian INSPIRE forum. Next to the Committtee, an INSPIRE cell is installed, which will take over the role of the Member State Contact Point and will take on the secretarial tasks of the Committee, the representative in the the Comitology Procedure and the Forum. The cooperation agreement was adopted on 2 April 2010. It will enter into force when all parties have adopted their own legislation endorsing the agreement. The Brussels Region has published its endorsement in April 2011. The legislative approvals of the other regions and the federal state still have to be published.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The federal state and each region have adopted legislation with regard to access to government information and the re-use of public sector information, each for the information held by the public bodies and the information under their competence. This legislation includes:


 The federal Law of 11 April 1994 relating to access to government information; EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Belgium K.U.Leuven (SADL) 14 


 The federal law of 5 August 2006 on public access to environmental information;  The Ordnance of the Council of the Brussels Region of 30 March 1995 on access to public administration; The Ordnance of the Council of the Brussels Region of 18 March 2004 on access to environmental information;  The Flemish Decree of 26 March 2004 relating to access to government information; The Decree of the Walloon Region of 30 March 1995 relating to access to government information. Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information has been transposed by the following legal instruments:


 The federal Law of 7 March 2007 and the Executive Decisions of 29 October 2007 and 29 April 2008; The Decree of the Walloon Region of 14 December 2006; The Decree of the Walloon Region of 14 December 2006 regarding the competences it exercises of the French Community The Decree of the French Community of 25 January 2007; The Decree of the German Community of 18 December 2006; The Flemish Decree of 27 April 2007 and the Executive Decisions of 19 July 2007 and 8 October 2007; The Brussels Ordnance of 6 March 2008.


In all legal acts, the choice is left to the public bodies whether or not they make their information available for re-use. The only exception to this are the departments of the ministry of the Flemish Region and some of their agencies. For these bodies, allowing the re-use of their documents is mandatory.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Belgian law of 30 June 1994 concerning Copyright and Neighbouring Rights does not expressly mention maps, plans and other works related to geography or topography as being capable of attracting copyright (contrary to the Berne Convention and many other national copyright laws). They do however fall within the category 'works of literature'. According to article 8, §2 of the above Copyright Law, there is no copyright on official documents (e.g. decrees, laws) of the government. Other data produced by the public sector (e.g. geospatial information) can however qualify for copyright protection and can thus be managed and exploited by the public authorities if this data meets the legal conditions for copyright protection. The Belgian law of 31 August 1998 concerning the legal protection of databases (implementation of Directive 96/9/EC of 11 March 1996) and the Belgian law of 30 June EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Belgium K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 1994 concerning the legal protection of computer programs (implementation of Directive 91/250/EC of 14 May 1991) could also offer legal protection to geographic data. The 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society was transposed by the law of 22 May 2005, which includes amendments to the Copyright law and the law on the protection of databases.


**Licensing framework**


Since 1 May 2009, access to the Urbis data is free of charge for non-commercial use and the use is allowed within the limits of a licence, the terms of which are accepted by downloading the products.

The main legal instruments specifically relating to GI include:ƒ Decree no. 2004-1246 of 22 November 2004 on the National Geographic Institute, consolidated in May 2005; ƒ Decision of 16 March 2005 stating the list of geographic data sets and cartography that has to be maintained by IGN as part of its public task;ƒ Decision of 19 April on the development and maintenance of the RGE;ƒ Decree on the role and the composition of the CNIG, onsolidated on 30 September 1999.


After the Ministry of Public Works had created a first draft for the transposition of the INSPIRE directive in 2007, the responsibility for the transposition was shifted to the Ministry of Environment, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea. During 2008 and 2009, a draft proposal was eveloped, but at the end of 2009, it was decided to transpose the directive by an Ordonnance. The law that allows this was submitted to the Senate in December 2009 (see


<http://www.ign.fr/institut/documentArticle.do?idDoc=5653965&indexRoot=3&indexChild=1>）


 


With this law, the Parliament agrees with legislation that is still to come, so that it  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 does not have to debate about the law when it is presented. This law is currently in the Chamber, but the Parliament has a backlog, so there is some delay. A text of the transposition law is ready, with a minimal transposition of the directive. Executive measures are necessary in order to fully transpose the directive. These will be ready by the end of the year (see <http://inspire.ign.fr/index.php/actualites-inspire>).


IGN performs its tasks on the basis of a contract with the government. This contract sets the objectives for a certain period, generally a couple of years. A new agreement was made in 2008 between IGN and the Ministry of Food Supply, Agriculture and Fisheries (MAAP) and the Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Seas (MEEDDM). In addition, the white paper on defence and national security published on July 31, 2008 planned a closer cooperation with the Ministry of Defence (see IGN, 2008 Activity report). Since 2010, an agreement on targets and performance between IGN and the government specifies the objectives for the period 2010-2013.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There is no true PPP in France. For instance, geometric experts having tasks relating to the cadastre are considered to have a public mission, so they cannot be considered as private partners in relationship to the state. The private sector is involved in the creation of value-added products, but rather as a client of the public sector data providers than as a partner. Currently, the private sector does not play a big role in the NSDI in France, but there are signs that its role will grow in the future.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


Law no. 78-753 of 17 July 1978 (‘Loi portant diverses mesures d'amélioration des relations entre l'administration et le public et diverses dispositions d'ordre administratif, social et fiscal’) regulates the freedom of access to administrative documents. This “CADA” law has been amended several times throughout the years. The law applies to central government, local government and the administrations of public undertakings. Requests may be refused on a limited number of grounds, such as state security, privacy and commercial secrets. Documents received may not be reproduced or redistributed for commercial purposes. Jurisprudence of this law allows the charging for data access. Directive 2003/98 on re-use of PSI was transposed by Ordonnance n° 2005-650 relative à la liberté d'accès aux documents administratifs et à la réutilisation des informations publiques of 6 June 2005 and by the Décret 2005-1755 relatif à la liberté d'accès aux documents administratifs et à la réutilisation des informations publiques, pris pour l'application de la loi n° 78-753 du 17 juillet 1978. The former contains a general right of re-use of all the information in the documents held by the administrations mentioned in the law of 1978. Directive 2003/4 was transposed into French law by the Law of 26  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 October 2005 (LOI no 2005-1319 du 26 octobre 2005 portant diverses dispositions d’adaptation au droit communautaire dans le domaine de l’environnement, <http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=DEVX0500055L>


 


The Agence du Patrimoine Immatériel d’Etat was established in 2007, under the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Budget, with among others the responsibility to help economic operators to access PSI for re-use and to create awareness with the public bodies with regard to the possibilities for re-use. For this, it has created model licences; it supports public bodies in developing their registers of information and has proposed to create a portal for access to all re-usable public sector information. APIE works closely with the Commission d’accès aux documents administratifs (CADA), and maintains contacts with the Groupement Français de l’Industrie de l’Information (GFII) and the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING) (see

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Intellectual Property Code of 1957 (revised several times throughout the years) includes a section on copyright. It provides a list of examples of works that may be protected which is similar to that of the Berne Convention. French courts have repeatedly decided works of GI to be subject to copyright. Database Directive 96/9/EC was implemented into law on 1 July 1998 by integrating the new rules into various sections of the French Intellectual Property Code. The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society is transposed by the Law on the digital economy.


No copyright exists in laws, decrees, court decisions, legal texts and so on. Maps belong to the same category as books, music and other artistic creation activities results. They therefore benefit of IPR protection under French law. Copyright is regulated by a system of licences. A licence for internal use exists, and several tariffs are in force depending on the amount of use to which the information is put. Government bodies also grant licences to private companies for the commercialisation of their data.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


French privacy legislation can be found in Law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 (Loi relative à l’informatique, aux fichiers et aux libertés). Most notably this legislation provides for a priori declaration of all databases containing nominative data, and a right of access and correction for information concerning oneself. This law is more protective of private life than many other European equivalent legislations. The Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL - National Commission for Information Technology  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20 and Individual Liberties) is the regulatory body set up to enforce and report on application of French Privacy law ([www.cnil.fr](http://www.cnil.fr/)). On 11 January 2000 the European Commission decided to take France to court for failure to notify all the measures necessary to implement Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data. Article 5 of Law no. 2000-321 of 12 April 2000 already amended Law no. 78-17. However, Directive 95/46/EC is now fully transposed into French law. On 30 January 2002 the French National Assembly therefore adopted a draft implementation law (projet de loi) regarding the processing of personal data, modifying Law no. 78-17. This law has been definitively adopted by an Assemblée National vote on the 29th of April 2004. The law of 22 June 200 concerning the digital economy has transposed both the 1995 directive on the processing of personal data and the 2002 directive on privacy and electronic communications into French law.


**Licensing framework**


The Ordonnance of 6 June 2005 on re-use of PSI states that if charges are made for the re-use, a licence has to be available, which holds the conditions for the re-use. These conditions can only put restrictions on the re-use for the purpose of the general interest, and in a roportionate way. Model licences should be available. Such model licences are provided by APIE, which makes available some model licences for the re-use of PSI on its website, for a one-off delivery and for continuous delivery of information. IGN provides general conditions for the use of its products and services on its website ([www.ign.fr](http://www.ign.fr/)) as well as a set of licences: standard licence, server licence, electronic representation, graphical representation, commercial exploitation, integration, etc. Specific terms are foreseen for the educational sector and the research sector. Parcel data and address data are only available for the public sector. On the geoportal www.geoportail.fr, one can also buy IGN data online. Payment can be done by bank transfer or by credit card. Price lists and terms of use are available on the website (<https://boutiquepro.ign.fr/index.php?event=DisplayInfosProduits>). Over 8000 contracts have been concluded via the Geoportal. Such general conditions are also provided by SHOM. These conditions have been set up in strong cooperation within the IHO Regional Hydrographic Commission for the North Sea (NSHC). Furthermore this NSHC has also established a principle of custodianship, by which a country A portraying on its charts the data owned by an other country B can authorize the re-use of the data of the country B (provided the corresponding fees are yearly paid to country B).


Another maritime example can be found in the Regional Electronic Navigation Chart established under the auspices of the IHO WEND commission: for instance Primar Stavanger, operated by the Norwegian Hydrographic Service, distributes (including  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 France K.U.Leuven (SADL) 21 weekly up-dating) the ENC of several countries, amongst which France. The conditions for the distributors are the same for all the countries participating in Primar Stavanger."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Act LVXXI of 1996 on Surveying and Mapping and the related Ministerial decrees provide the core of the legal background of GIS-related issues. All official surveying, mapping and related activities are governed by this Act. The basic aim of the Act is to ensure that base maps covering the total area of the country are available, as to enable land registration, development of geographic information systems, and a wide range of applications on various economic, scientific and social subjects. The Act makes it compulsory to use the governmental base map data to create GIS.


The Joint Decree No 21/1997 “On execution of some rules defined by the Law LXXVI of 1996 on Activities in Surveying and Mapping” regulates the co-operation between the ministers responsible for surveying and mapping activities and the rules and conditions for the operation of a Map Supply Coordination Committee. Resolution No. 13 from 1997 of the Governmental Commission on Informatics and Telecommunications provides further steps toward the set up of an NSDI. Recently, new legislation has been added that is also of importance for the legal framework for the Hungarian SDI. The amendment of the Environmental Law of December 2008 entered into force on 15 May 2009, and Government decree 241/2009.X.29 setting up the National Environmental Spatial Information System is ready to be officially adopted, including the implementation of the INSPIRE directive. Next to this decree, Government decision 1176/2009 (X. 26) setting up and clarifying tasks of the committee supporting the work of the INSPIRE contact point is also ready to enter into force. The remaining rules of the directive that needed to be transposed are included in a new governmental decree 241/2009.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Private commercial firms are indirectly involved in helping to implement the NSDS as subcontractor e.g. in the implementation of the National Cadastral Program in a competitive environment. For the surveying and mapping, there is a partnership supported by the Chamber of Engineers, the Hungarian Society of Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, the HUNGIS Foundation, etc.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Hungary K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 There are particular efforts to strengthen PPP under the EU-ESA-initiative on GMES through collaboration between HUNAGI-FÖMI-HSO-EUSC.


**Policy and legislation on access to and reuse of public sector information (PSI)**


The Constitution of Hungary states that “in the Republic of Hungary everyone has the right to know and to disseminate data of public interest”. This fundamental right was elaborated in the Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Accessibility of Public Data, which requires all government agencies at national or local level to facilitate access to information in their possession, and to make accessible data concerning their activities, data types held by them, and acts concerning their operation. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has partially been transposed (see <http://ec.europa.eu/environment/impel/pdf/enforcementnoteaccess.pdf>). Act LIII of 1995 was amended to specify that environmental data must be accessible for everyone (except sensitive data). Directive 2003/98 on re-use of PSI been fully transposed through the amended Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Accessibility of Public Data; the Act on Publication of Data of Public Interest; and the 2005 Act on Freedom of Information by Electronic Means.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The most important rule of the Hungarian copyright-related legislation is the Law LXXVI of 1999 on Copyright, which was modified during the past decade several times. It explicitly protects photographs and maps and cartographic works. In 2000, the decision was taken by the Government in the Law Approximation Program to revise the copyright and related laws in order to ensure the harmonization with the copyright directives of the European Union, and to meet the requirement needed for the Hungarian adoption of the Copyright Agreement in the institutional framework of the WIPO. The sui generis right was included in the Copyright Act in 2001. Directive 2001/29 on copyright in the information society was also transposed into Hungarian law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Article 59 of the Hungarian Constitution protects the individual’s right to the ""good standing of his reputation"" as well as the inviolability of his or her home, private affairs and personal data. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 ungary K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 Furthermore, the protection of personal data is assured by Act LXIII of 1992 on protection of personal data and the disclosure of data of public interest. The purpose of this Act is to guarantee the right of everyone to exercise control over his or her personal data and to have access to data of public interest, except as otherwise provided by law under this Act. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information plays the same role concerning the protection of personal data as he does for the access to public sector documents. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into national law."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

In May 2011, the Act on the Infrastructure for Digital Spatial Data was adopted. The law stipulates what has to be implemented (data, metadata and services) and how this has to be organised (role LMI, coordinating structure, elaboration of an implementation plan, etc.). This legislation is based on a decision of the EEA countries to implement the INSPIRE Directive (Agreement on the European Economic Area, as amended by the EEA Joint Committee No. 55/2010 from 30 April 2010). The act also stipulates the changes to existing legislation. More in particular to Article 4 of Act no. 103/2006, on land surveying and basic mapping (see further). The activities and responsibilities of the National Land Survey of Iceland were laid down in a law of 1997 (Law no. 95/1997), with subsequent amendments in December 1998 and December 2000). The law covers the field of surveying and mapmaking, including provisions for the control of the Ministry of Environment and the purpose of the LMI as a governmental institution. A new law on land surveying and basic mapping was approved by the Icelandic Parliament on June 3, 2006. This law dealt with the role and tasks of NLSI and stipulated a.o. that NSLI withdraw from its competitive operations and that the institute has to sell its stock of maps and CDs before January 1, 2007. The law states that the tasks of the National Land Survey of Iceland are:


 To advise the Ministry for the Environment in NLSI’s operational fields and as regards policy making in land surveying and official basic mapping.


 The structure and maintenance of reference materials and accessible geodetic reference systems and height reference systems for the whole of Iceland.


 To take the initiative in the making and applying of standards in a geographic information system (GIS).


 To make, maintain and disseminate digital layers on a scale of 1:50.000 and on smaller scales.


 To provide access to data which NLSI keeps in its databases.


 To register and disseminate information about spatial data in Iceland.


 To engage in professional co-operation with universities, institutes, businesses and international organizations in accordance with the tasks of the institute. The Act on the Infrastructure for Digital Spatial Data added following task to this list:


 To oversee execution of the Act on infrastructure for spatial data, incl. taking responsibility for operations, maintenance and technological development of spatial data. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Iceland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The LMI determines on an individual basis whether a project should be handled in-house,


or by a sub-contractor after advertising for bids. As a good example of a successful collaboration, the municipality of Reykjavík, in cooperation with the state telecommunication company, has been developing and running LUKR, the Reykjavík GIS, since 1988.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information**


The Icelandic Freedom of Information Act no. 50 of 1996 applies to state and municipal administration and to the activities of private parties insofar as they have been entrusted with official power to take decisions regarding people's rights or obligations. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been transposed by Act No 23/2006 on the right to environmental information (<http://web.eftasurv.int/details.aspx?memberState=ISL&ecRef=2003/4>). The Freedom of information Act was amended in 2006 to incorporate the provisions of directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information. In 2009, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a working group to review the Act in order to consider the expansion of access to public sector information, and possibly extend the scope of the Act to private bodies that are fully owned by the Icelandic government (see


<http://www.epsiplatform.eu/news/news/iceland_review_information_act>).


**Legal protection of GIS by intellectual property rights**


The Copyright Act no. 73 of 29 May 1972 has been amended by Act no. 78 of 30 May 1984, Act no. 57 of 2 June 1992 and Act no. 145 of 27 December 1996. Act no. 60 of 19 May 2000 inserted article 50, which provides legal protection for databases. The last amendments of the Copyright Act took effect in 2006 (Act on amendments to the Copyright Act No 73/1972 with later amendments, no. 9/2006  <http://web.eftasurv.int/details.aspx?memberState=ISL&ecRef=2001/29>), when the 2001/29/EC directive on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society was transposed. Article 49 of the Copyright Act offers special legal protection to photographs. Article 8 of the law on land surveying and basic mapping stipulates that the State owns all rights acquired by the LMI. The institute protects the interests of the State in the areas of copyrights and utilisation rights regarding all materials that it has acquired, processed or published in connection with the surveying, mapping or photographing of Iceland. In addition, matters concerning copyrights are also contained within copyright bill, no. 73/1972, with later amendments. Article 9 stipulates that the LMI communicates information and provides access to data in its archives. Regarding original material derived from outside the institute, further distribution of such material shall be preceded by an agreement with the original source. It is permitted to grant utilisation rights for all EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Iceland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 information in the areas of surveying and mapping that is stored in the LMI’s archives, under the conditions that the source is credited and that the credibility of the information is not compromised. The new Act on the Infrastructure for Digital Spatial Data does not impact the authorities’ copyrights on spatial data which appertain to the law. Digital spatial data owned by parties others than those explicitly mentioned in the law will be subject to it if the owner of the information has received permission to connect it to the geoportal, cf. Article 5, on the basis of this law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The data protection principles of Directive 95/46/EEC have been implemented into Icelandic law by means of the Data Protection and Handling of Personal Information Act no. 77 of 2000. On 1 January 2000 this Act came into force. Its last amendment dates from 2003 (Act no. 46/2003). Directive 2002/58/EC was transposed by the Electronic Communications Act no. 81 of 25 July 2003 (<http://www.pta.is/upload/files/Electronic%20Communications%20Act%202003.pdf>).


**Licensing framework**


The Information department of the LMI handles operations in the area of disseminating information to the community, the sale of data and the handling of publishing licenses. The publishing of maps, aerial photographs and other materials is allowed upon written permission and the payment of royalty fees. The largest source of income for the LMI in 2008 from the sale of data was the sale of subscriptions to the IS 50V database, with 25 new subscribers. The users can subscribe to the entire database, or select the areas and layers that they need (National Land Survey, Annual Report 2008, Next, aerial photographs can also be purchased, either by downloading the photographs or by buying copies on a CD."

The need for a legal framework is one of the issues addressed in the Irish Spatial Data Infrastructure Consultation Document mentioned above. However, until now no  compassing legal framework has been developed. The transposition of the INSPIRE directive has been prepared. The directive will be transposed under the 1972 European Communities Act. On 30 July 2010 John Gormley TD, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, signed Statutory Instrument No382 which brought into effect on 1 August 2010 the transposition of the INSPIRE Directive.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The Irish Government has a policy of encouraging PPPs in certain sectors. However, no PPP structure currently exists in relation to the ISDI


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


Access to public sector information is organised by the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as it was amended in 2003. This Act regulates access to public sector information with several exclusions. Access to publicly held information is nationally free of charge. However, government departments may charge for the time taken to extract the information requested. Under this act, anyone is entitled to apply for access to records not otherwise publicly available. Requests have to comply with a number of formalities. They have to be in writing, although e-mails are also acceptable. If information is desired in a particular form, this should be mentioned in the application. Applications should be as detailed as possible to ensure that the staff of the Department where access is requested, is in a position to identify the records being sought. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations, S.I.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Ireland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15 133 of 2007. Directive 2003/98 on re-use of PSI was transposed by Statutory Instrument no. 279 of 2005, “European Communities (Re-use of Public Sector Information) Regulations 2005”. Under these regulations, there is no obligation for the public sector bodies to make their information available. If they decide to do so, they have to follow the Regulations.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Irish Copyright Act of 1963 was replaced by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000. It protects works that are original and expressed in a certain form. Copyright protection expires 70 years after the death of the author. No specific measures are taken concerning the protection of geographic or photographic works. The Government can also be a copyright holder, but its copyright expires fifty years after the work was made. The Directive on the legal protection of databases was incorporated in the Copyright Act 2000. It also implemented the main terms of the then draft Directive 2001/29 on the Harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society. On 19th January 2004 Ireland transposed Directive 2001/29 into Irish law by the law enacting the European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2004. 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Irish Government adopted the Data Protection Act in 1998 in order to transpose the European Directive on data protection of 1995 into national legislation. The Act addresses personal data in the area of information gathering, retention and use of collected personal information. It states that computer users must observe the data protection principles when using a computerised file containing personal information. Data held in hard copy is not covered by the Act. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into Irish law on 6 November 2003. Next to the Data Protection Act, the Freedom of Information Act also provides for a number of protective measures for certain categories of information. Exemptions are made to the general rule of access to records of public authorities that are not publicly available. These exemptions include personal information, information obtained in confidence, and commercially sensitive information. The Land Registry has its own policy on privacy. Its documents can only be consulted by the registered owner of the property, any person authorized by the registered owner and a limited number of other persons authorized by the Land Registration Rules 1972. A request can also be made under the Freedom of Information Act, but when it concerns a record holding personal information, the request will only be granted with the consent of the subject.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Ireland K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16


**Licensing framework**


According to the PSI Regulations, a public sector body may allow for re-use of documents without conditions or may impose conditions, where appropriate through a license, dealing with relevant issues. Such conditions cannot unnecessarily restrict possibilities for re-use and cannot be used to restrict competition. Any applicable conditions for the re-use of documents have to be non-discriminatory for comparable categories of re-use. The Minister has to ensure that standard licenses for the re-use of documents, which can be adapted to meet particular license applications, are available in digital format and can be processed electronically. There is no unified licensing framework. The geo-data providers have their own licensing policies. Ordnance Survey Ireland provides data to public customers via outlets throughout the country, through and agent network and via online ordering. For reproducing maps in publications such as books, flyers, academic publications, etc., an application form has to be filled out. Terms and conditions and a price list can be found on the website (<http://www.osi.ie/en/alist/copyright.aspx>). Separate annual licences are available for architects, engineers and surveyors, for auctioneers, estate agents and valuers, and for solicitors and legal firms. Finally, a separate licence is available for Internet use. For business and industry use of data sets (including government), distinctions are made between annual licences and project licences. Specific conditions apply to academic and research use (<http://www.osi.ie/en/alist/digital_licence.aspx>).The Irish Geological Survey moved towards making its data freely available for any type of use in 2009. The data is delivered in a zip-file together with a data licence agreement. The data is for exclusive use of the user and cannot be passed on. The source of the data must be acknowledged and where data are used in manipulated or value-added form as a commercial product, a royalty may be owned."

**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The Cypriot commercial information market is small and relatively undeveloped. Private commercial firms are partially involved in spatial data capture projects through commonly agreed procedures and contracts.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The Republic of Cyprus has ratified the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (“the Aarhus Convention”) by passing Law No.33(III)/2003. Further, the Parliament of Cyprus passed the Law on Public Access to Information Related to the Environment of 2004 - No.119(I)/2004 for the purposes of harmonising its legislation with Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. According to Law No.119(I)/2004, public authorities are obliged to make available environmental information held by or for them to any applicant at his request, and without his having to state or prove an interest. Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information was transposed in November 2006 by Law No 132 (I)/2006. Spatial data maintained by DLS is currently considered as property of DLS and the Government, and is not readily available to the public without official permission. Cadastral and topographical spatial and legal/fiscal information exported from the Land Information System databases are currently distributed in digital form to other Government Departments and semi-government organizations upon their request. Spatial cadastral, topographical, legal and fiscal data can be accessed by officially applying to DLS Director. Citizens do not directly get access to the cadastral data, but they can get a Certificate of registration of Immovable Property. Other geographic data such as aerial photographs and topographical datasets are provided both in raster and vector form to interested persons or organizations.

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Cyprus Law relating to Copyright is set out in the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Law of 1976 to 2006 (Law No. 59/1976, as amended by Laws 63/77, 18(I)/1993, 54(I)/1999, 12(I)/2001, 128(I)2002, 128(I)/2004 and 123(I)/2006). The amendment of 2004 included the 2001 Copyright Directive into Cypriot law. The Copyright Act does not contain any specific protection for maps or geographic data, but it does protect photographs. All works created by or under the direction or control of the Government are explicitly protected by copyright.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Constitution of Cyprus contains the following articles related to privacy in Appendix D, PART II. Article 15 guarantees that ""every person has the right to respect for his private and family life."" Article 16 guarantees that ""every person's dwelling house is inviolable"" and Article 17 guarantees that ""every person has the right to respect for, and to the secrecy of, his correspondence and other communication if such other communication is made through means not prohibited by law"" and ""there shall be no interference with the exercise of this right except in accordance with the law and only in cases of convicted and unconvicted prisoners and business correspondence and communication of bankrupts during the bankruptcy administration."" The protection of personal data is regulated by Law 138(I) of 23 November 2001 on the Protection of Personal Data. It is based on the Data Protection Directive of the EU. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communication was transposed in national law in June 2004, in the Regulation of Electronic Communications and Postal Services Law. The National Land Information System was designed in such a way to provide several security levels and to provide access to several groups of authorized users. Confidential information is kept only for internal DLS use and access is restricted.


**Licensing framework**


Digital spatial geographic data is provided under terms and conditions. A specific set of terms governs the supply of digital cadastral plans, digital topographic information, and digital legal/fiscal records. The user is not allowed to copy, digitize, reproduce or transfer the data without the permission of the director of DLS. He can only use them for his own purposes within the agreement and is not allowed to provide the maps or part of them to any other persons or organizations. For large projects which involve the bulk supply of digital geographic data, separate agreements are signed between the interested parties and the Director of DLS. Standard licences are currently being set up to harmonise the description of conditions for different groups of stakeholders."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Next to the strategic documents for the NGII programme, which were adopted by the state administrative bodies, regional and local governments, and professional unions and the private sector, the following legal instruments should be mentioned. First, Law 183/2006 Sb. on landscape planning and building regulations – in force since 1 January 2007 – imposes the development and updating of “spatial analytical data records”, which have the character of spatial data derived from primary sources and expected (even though it is not explicitly required in the law) to be available in digital form. Next, the amendment of the State Statistical Act (act no. 89/1995 Sb o státní statistické službě) in 2006 imposed the development of system of statistical registers including a territorial Register of census districts and buildings. The INSPIRE directive was transposed by an amendment of Act No. 123/1998 Coll. On the Right of Access to Environmental Information (Aarhus Convention) and entered into force in November 2009. The executive regulation is currently in preparation. At the same time the Act on the Right of Access to Environmental Information was amended, Act No. 200/1994 Coll. On surveying was also changed.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There is no tradition of PPP’s. Nevertheless their usefulness and necessity are now considered to be obvious. Good examples can be found in several areas, e.g. in the cooperation and functioning of CAGI and Nemoforum. Concrete examples of broader importance are e.g. the cooperation between public and private institutions and organizations in the production of the information system of the cadastre and real estates or the cooperation between the Czech Ministry of Informatics and the Czech Association for Geoinformation.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


In general terms, access to information is regulated by the law on free access to information on public administration activities and actions (Act no. 106/1999), which entered into force in January 2000. The Act gives citizens the right to ask for any information connected with the functioning and dealing of the state administrative bodies, local self-governing authorities and certain other official institutions. Act 106/1999 is based on the Freedom of Access to Environmental Information Act (123/1998 Sb.). This act regulates the compulsory availability to the public of a range of information and adopts the Aarhus Convention and Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information. Act 106/1999 also implements the PSI directive, by an amendment of 2006. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Czech Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 The transposition of INSPIRE has amended the Act on Freedom of Access to Environmental Information, ensuring that citizens do not need any specific application to access the free of charge maps, and imposing technical parameters on the spatial data. Searching data on the Geo-Portal is free of charge, while charges are made for download, analysis and specific actions.

Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights On 1 December 2000 the Copyright Act (Law no. 121/2000 of 7 April 2000 on Copyright, Rights Related to Copyright and on the Amendment of Certain Laws) came into effect. Article 3 of the Copyright Act determines that copyright protection does not apply to an official work, such as legal regulations, decisions, public charters, publicly accessible registers and the collection of their records, and also official drafts of an official work and other preparatory official documentation including the official translation of such work, Chamber of Deputies and Senate publications, memorial chronicles of a municipality (municipal chronicle), state symbols and symbols of a regional self-governing unit, and other such works where there is public interest in their exclusion from copyright protection. On the other hand, the act gives traditionally copyright to cartographic products. A related important copyrighted area is the protection of databases schemas. The Czech Copyright Act of 2000 was discussed in the Parliament in 2005-2006 in order to complete the implementation of the EU Copyright Directive and the EU  nforcement Directive. The amendments were adopted in summer 2006.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The individual’s privacy is safeguarded by article 7(1) of the 1993 Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Article 10 provides the right to human dignity, protection from unauthorized interference in person and family life, and misuse of his or her personal information. Article 13 prohibits the violation of ""letters and other papers and records"" held privately or communicated through the mail or other means. Act no. 101 of 2000 on Personal Data Protection came into force on 1 June 2000. It is based on the EU Data Protection Directive as part of the Czech Republic's efforts towards membership of the EU. The new act creates an Office for Personal Data Protection as an independent supervisory body. The ""Act on Information Society Services"" (ISS Bill) implements Article 7 of Directive 2000/31/EC and Article 13 of Directive 2002/58/EC.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2010 Czech Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17


**Licensing framework**


Datasets produced and managed by the public administrations are available under very different conditions depending on the bodies and authorities themselves. No general approach or regulations exist yet. Besides licensing, general trade agreements and other approaches can be found. In general every transfer is considered as a special trade case and no general and prefabricated licenses are available in advance (exceptions exist). The geodata portal offers map services for on-line access to data and a business module for direct ordering of digital data files and map services, and printed maps of the Land Survey Office. Orders can be made electronically after registering on the website. Different license agreements are available for personal use and any other use. The agreements have to be printed, signed and sent between the Land Survey and the customer, and then the data are delivered, either by e-mail, download from the server, personal withdrawal or regular mail. For the INSPIRE geoportal, one universal licence will be applied that will regulate the use of the data and services."					Monday, June 13, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The Government of the Republic Act lists the institutions which have executive power and defines the area of government for every ministry (e.g. for the Ministry of the Environment, the performance of tasks relates to land and databases containing spatial data, the management of the use, protection, recycling and registration of natural resources, the management of meteorological observation, nature and marine research, geological, cartographic and geodetic operations, the maintenance of the land cadastre and water cadastre, …). The executive agencies under each Ministry are also listed in the Act, e.g. the Land Board under the Ministry of the Environment. Every Ministry or Executive Agency has a statute which concretizes its area of activities and functions. The statute of the Ministry of the Environment can be found on its homepage ([http://www.envir.ee](http://www.envir.ee/)) Its functions include managing the use of natural resources and environment and nature protection, land related activities, keeping state registers. The statute of the Land Board can be found on [http://www.maaamet.ee](http://www.maaamet.ee/), and includes tasks in the field of land cadastre and geodesy andcartography. The Estonian Environment Information Centre ([http://keskkonnainfo.ee](http://keskkonnainfo.ee/)) maintains the environmental register and classificators, maintains environmental monitoring data, the dumping site register and data of protected sites and environmental resources.


The Database Act (last amended in 2007 and incorporated in the Public Information Act) provides procedures for possession, use and disposal of state and local government databases, provides general principles of maintenance of databases belonging to the state, local governments and persons in private law, and for release and use of their data. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Estonia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 General national registers are maintained (listed only spatial data related) regarding (Par.25) the population (residents) of the state, immovable property and other significant subjects. General national registers are established by corresponding Acts. State registers are established by a regulation of the Government of the Republic. The Act also defines supporting systems for the maintenance of databases:


1. The classification system;


2. The geodetic system;


3. The system of address details;


4. the system of security measures for information systems;


5. the data exchange layer of information systems.


6. the administration system of the State Information System.


Use of support systems for the maintenance of databases is mandatory upon maintenance of all state and local government databases.The Regulation on Geodetic System was passed 5 Feb. 2004 and entered into force 21 Feb. 2004 (see 2.3.3) and the Regulation on imposing of the system of address details was passed 20 December 2007 and entered into force 1 January 2008. ELB has started to establish a central address data management system. Under the Regulation, this management system is functional from 1 January 2009. The Regulation on the data exchange layer of information systems (passed 19 Dec. 2003, entered into force 1 Jan. 2004) impose common principles for managing and operation of the internet based technical and technological environment for secure data exchange (XRoad, spelled as ‘crossroad’, in Estonian X-tee). X-Road (http://www.ria.ee) enables to use databases registered in the State Register of Databases through a unified interface. Through X-Road citizens are able to view their personal data, public authorities can use targeted services (juridical unified administration of matters, editing data) and legal entities have a unified portal for interaction with public authorities. Databases including spatial components and joined with X-Road are among others the system of address details, Constructions Register, Title Book, Register of Objects of Cultural Heritage, Land Cadastre, Land Cadastre and Municipal Lands Register of the City of Tallinn. The INSPIRE directive was transposed by the adoption and amendment of several Acts. For an overview, see <http://eurlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:72007L0002:EN:NOT#FIELD_E>.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The ELB maintains several spatial databases (geodetic network, topographic maps, special maps), but it has only very small production capabilities (aerial works, photogrammetry) and a majority of the works (building and measuring of geodetic networks, cartographic production, software development) are outsourced through public procurements. The Department of Land Cadastre of ELB registers land and maintains the  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Estonia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 Land Cadastre. All actual land surveying works are however carried out by private surveyors or companies at landowners’ own expense. 


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


The Public Information Act (RT I 2000, 92, 597) was passed on 15 November 2000 and it came into force on 1 January 2001. The Act covers state and local agencies, legal persons in public law and private entities that are conducting public duties including educational, health care, social or other public services. The Act also includes significant provisions on electronic access. The Database Act was consolidated into the Public Information Act on 4 December 2007 and entered into force on 1 January 2008. The Act establishes the State Information System. Cadastral data are public and everyone has right to access the data, except the data about ownership. The right to use data is free of charge for state agencies and local governments. EU Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information and EU Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI have been implemented into Estonian law.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Copyright Act was passed 11 November 1992 (RT 1992, 49, 615; RT I 1999, 36, 469) and entered into force on 12 December 1992. The last amendments were made in 2007. In §4(17) of the Copyright Act it is stipulated that copyright exists in photographic works, whereas in §4(18) it is stipulated that copyright exists in cartographic works (topographic, geographic, geological, etc. maps, atlases, models). According to §5 of the Copyright Act legislation, administrative documents (acts, decrees, regulations, statutes, instructions, directives) and court decisions, and official translations thereof, are not protected by copyright law. Chapter VIII of the Estonian Copyright Act provides for special legal protection of databases. This chapter was inserted by the Act of 9 December 1999. The copyright and ownership of data and publications produced by ELB’s order belong to the Land Board.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The 1992 Estonian Constitution includes several statements on privacy. Article 22 states that ""Everyone has the right to the inviolability of private and family life. State agencies,  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Estonia  .U.Leuven (SADL) 20 local governments, and their officials shall not interfere with the private or family life of any person, except in the cases and pursuant to procedure provided by law to protect health, morals, public order, or the rights and freedoms of others, to combat a criminal offence, or to apprehend a criminal offender."" Article 42 protects against the governmentauthorized collection or storage of personal data without the citizen’s consent. The Personal Data Protection Act was passed on 12 February 2003 and entered into force on 1 October 2003. It was amended in Dec. 2007.


**Licensing framework**


Data from the Estonian Land Board can be viewed free of charge. Downloading is regulated by a Decree from the Ministry of Environment.

The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Character was adopted on 25 January 2006 and is applicable from September 2006. Under the law, any natural or legal person has the right to obtain information from public authorities by filing a request. The request can be oral, in writing or by electronic means (see<http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/31/topic/3>). The Regulation for the manner and procedure of exercising the right to a free access to public information (no. 01-3563/1, date 27.03.2007) regulates the access to information from the cadastre (see<http://www.katastar.gov.mk/en/Page.aspx?Id=216&m=1490>).


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Article 47 of the Constitution guarantees the rights that stem from scientific, artistic or other intellectual works. The Law on Copyright and Related Rights dates from 1996 and has been amended to harmonise it with the European legislation on copyright and related rights, including the 1996 database directive.In 2009, preparations started for a new draft legislation on copyright (Ministry of Economy, Strategy for Intellectual Property of the FYR Macedonia 2009-2012). The law protects individual and intellectual creations in the field of literature, science, arts and the domains of creation, regardless of the type, manner and form of expression. Explicit mention is made of photographic works and cartographic works, plans, sketches, technical drawings, projects, tables, plastic works and other works of identical or similar character in domain of geography, topography, architecture or other scientific, educational, technical or artistic nature (article 12). Official texts from the legislative, executive or judicial sphere and their translations, when published as an official text, are not protected (article 16).

The founding law of the Hellenic Mapping and Cadastral Organization (HEMCO) (law no. 1647/1986) deals with the use, dissemination of personal data and general national security issues. Law 3882/2010 FEK 166A on the creation of the National Geospatial Information Infrastructure (EVGEP) is the law that transposes the INSPIRE Directive. The Law was adopted on September 22, 2010 and aims to ensure equal access to geospatial data and services for all citizens and Public Administration. The Law is the answer to the need to: 


a) establish harmonized practices and standards for the collection, production, procurement, management, sharing and distribution of geospatial data and 


 b) comply with Directive 2007/2/EC (INSPIRE), which provides a framework of technical specifications for interoperability to enable the automated sharing of geospatial data in the environment (e.g. areas NATURA 2000) at national and European level.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The Hellenic Mapping and Cadastre Organization was created in 1986 and is the official cartographic agency in Greece operating under the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. One of the responsibilities include the establishment of the National Cadastre system. In July 1994, the HEMCO started with the preparation for the building of the Hellenic Cadastre. For this purpose, a company was created: “Ktimatologio S.A.” , a Legal Entity of Private Law with the mission to study, develop and operate the Hellenic Cadastre. The company was founded with a joint decision of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Minister of Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works (Decision 81706/6085/6-10-1995/Government Gazette 872Β/19-10-1995). Ktimatologio S.A. operates according to the rules of private finance and the provisions of article 5 of Law 2229/1994, of the coded Law 2190/1920, of Law 2308/1995 and Law Ν.2664/1998, as these stand today. Furthermore, the company does not fall under the class of organizations and businesses of the broader state sector; regulations that concern companies directly or indirectly owned by the State do not apply to Ktimatologio S.A. The sole shareholder of the company is the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. However, since there is no private capital involved, it is not considered as a true PPP. Both the HEMCO and Ktimatologio S.A. (Hellenic Cadastre) are members of EuroGeographics.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Greece K.U.Leuven (SADL) 13


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The main laws regulating and facilitating access to the information maintained by the Public Sector are:


1. Law 2690/1999 “Hellenic Code for Administrative Procedure” (especially article 5) which replaced law 1599/1986 “State–Citizen Relations”. It is a new freedom of information act that gives citizens the right of access to the administrative documents created by government agencies.


2. Law 3448/2006 “Reuse of public Sector Information, Local authorities Affairs etc” through which PSI Directive 2003/1998 was transposed into national law.


3. The Common Ministerial Decision No 11764/653 of 17th March 2006 by ajoint Ministerial Decision (Minister of Interior, Public Administration and Decentralization, the Minister of Economy and Finance, the Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change and the Minister of Justice), through which the European Directive 2003/4/EC concerning the access to environmental information was transposed into national law.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights** 


In the past decade Greece has rapidly caught up with the rest of Europe by introducing modernized laws in the area of intellectual property. The Greek Copyright Act (Law no. 2121/1993) was a landmark in the legal history of copyright in Greece. However, the copyright legislation is still considered to be inadequate for the development of an NSDI. This is partly covered by the transposition of the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society. Directive 96/9 of the European Parliament and the Council of 11-3-1996 concerning the Legal Protection of Databases and other Regulations on the legal protection of databases was implemented in Greece by specific legal provisions (art. 7 of Law 2819/2000). Article 2 of the Copyright Act stipulates that the protection afforded under this Law shall not apply to official texts expressive of the authority of the State, notably to legislative,  dministrative or judicial texts. The Hellenic Military Geographical Service has set restrictions to the access to spatial datasets and services due to National Defense for classified areas. Law 3257/2004 “Regulation of the Armed Forces Staff Affairs” and especially article 11, which amended article 13 of the Legislative Decree 1013/1971, refers to the protection of  tellectual property rights of the Hellenic Military Geographical Service in cases of use by the public or private sector of the geographical data produced and maintained by this Service, while an approval by the same Service is required before any production, dissemination or circulation of high resolution (i.e., higher than 1 meter) geographical data or imagery acquired from any source. With regard to the protection of national defense within the EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Greece K.U.Leuven (SADL) 14 HNC, high-level representation of the Ministry of Defense ensures that, for what concerns policy on spatial information sharing arrangements, decisions will not compromise national security. With regard to international relations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has an important role in collaboration with the ministry of Defense. Map production in Greece is considered as work, that is, original intellectual scientific creation related to geography, surveying, architecture and science in general. As work, it is protected by Greek legislation and especially law 2121/1993 “About Intellectual Property and Related Rights”. The Hellenic Military Service is the Greek authority that produces and provides topographic maps in Greece. These maps are used as reference base maps by most public authorities.


However, until 2010, the data sharing arrangements and intellectual property right restrictions for the use and reproduction of these maps posed significant barriers, both economic and practical, with regard to the development and data sharing of spatial information generated from the use of those, such as geological maps. The INSPIRE-Law for the ""National Geospatial Information Infrastructure” mandates the obligatory free sharing of spatial data and services within the public sector as well as to to the public for non-commercial uses. The establishment of the catalogue of existing datasets and services and their metadata within the national geoportal, following the determination of focal points and establishment of datasets owners, provides the necessary technical and governance supportive measures to enable the effective implementation of the law. As a result, the data of the governmental bodies are becoming freely available for the public through geodata.gov.gr (open data) which offers open data on the background of Google maps, open street map and LandInc accordingly their specific simplified and standardized data and license agreements. Other geospatial data are provided using the specific terms of the Greek license Creative Commons Attribution ( CC BY V.3.0) as specified in detail in the relevant license .

During the last decade, Greece harmonized its legislation to the one in force in the European Union by introducing modern laws for the protection of intellectual property but also of privacy. More specifically:


1. Law 2472/1997: “Protection of the Individual from the Processing of Personal Data” (<http://www.dpa.gr/legal_eng.htm>) that follows the provisions of European Directive 95/46/EC concerning the protection of personal data.


2. Law 2915/2001 and especially article 34: “Amendment of Law 2472/1997 – Protection of the Individual from the Processing of Personal Data”


3. Law 3057/2002 and especially article 81: “Harmonization with Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 29-5-2001 for the Harmonization of Certain Aspects of the Creator and of Related Rights to the Information Society and other Regulations”.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Greece K.U.Leuven (SADL) 15


4. The Presidential Decree No 131/2003: “Adaptation to Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and the Council concerning Certain Legal Aspects of the Information Society Services, especially Electronic Commerce, in the Internal Market”.


5. Law 3471/2006: “Protection of Personal Data and of Private Life in the Electronic Communications Sector and Amendments to Law 2472/1997” through which Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 12-7-2002 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into Greek law.


**Licensing framework**


Until the new law ‘National Infrastructure for Geospatial Information”, a clear and harmonized licensing national policy concerning spatial datasets and services, either among public authorities or for public access did not exist. Law 3882/20107  creates the National Geospatial Information Infrastructure which includes the establishment of general principles , rules, measures and procedures in administrative, legal and technological level for the organization of uniform management practices, availability and sharing of geospatial information."

Law n.68 of the 2/2/1960 assigns the mandate for the collection of Geographic Information to the five National Mapping Agencies :


 Agenzia del Territorio of the Ministry of Finance (former Cadastral Agency);


 The Navy Hydrographical Institute (IIM);


 The Italian Military Geographical Institute (IGM);


 The Air Force Geo-topographical Information Centre (CIGA);


 The National Technical Services (STN).


The 1996 GIS agreement (Intesa Stato-Region ed Enti Locali per la realizzazione dei Sistemi Informativi Geografici di interesse generale” (Agreement between the State, Regions and Local Authorities for the implementation of Geographic Information Systems of general interest) (amended in 2000) was an important step in the development of the Italian NSDI. The agreement was signed by various Ministries, the Regions and some other Local Authorities with the objective to set-up the Italian NSDI, to increase the availability of geographic data and to stimulate harmonisation by the adoption of specifications. Partners in the agreement included the Ministry of Environment, Land Protection and Sea, Minstry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Treasury, Budget and Economic Planning, Public Works, Health, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Transport and Navigation Regional Affairs, AIPA:the Authority for Information Technology in Public Administration, the National Institute of Statistics; furthermore: the Municipalities (ANCI), Provinces (UPI) and Mountain Communities (UNCEM), Companies for the management of public servies (CISPEL) and the Conference of Presidents of Regions and Autonomous Provinces, The Italian e-Government policy and legislation has also been important for the development of the NSDI. The decree creating the Codex for Digital Administration (“Codice dell’Amministrazione Digitale”) was adopted in 2005 and entered into force on 1 January 2006. It is a general decree on e-Administration with articles specifically referring to GI. As was mentioned before, article 59 establishes the “Comitato per le regole tecniche sui dati territoriali” (Committee for technical specifications on GI) and the “Repertorio Nazionale dei Dati Territoriali” (National GI Repository). 


Next to its technical tasks, the Committee should also create rules on the sharing of spatial data at the national and the sub-national level. In 2007, the Committee and the Agenzia del Territorio (the new Cadastral Agency) created technical and economic rules for the sharing of cadastral data between public bodies, compliant with article 59 of the Codex.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Italy K.U.Leuven (SADL) 24 The INSPIRE Directive was translated into national law by Decreto Legislativo 27.01.2010 n. 32; main objectives: public access to data and services, construction of an efficient SDI and re-use of data. The Ministry of Environment, Land Protection and Sea is appointed as the responsible authority for the implementation and is supported by the The Institute for Environmental Protection and Research.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


The CTC manages to interact with private sector companies working in the data production sector. This is especially true for data production at regional and municipal level. At these levels, data production has traditionally been carried out by private companies under technical coordination of the public authorities.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


There is a general law for cost-free access to PSI (Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990) that provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest. The specific conditions for access are regulated by the ministry involved. Regional law mentioned in document (“Disciplina generale sulla tutela e l'uso del territorio (L.R. 20, 24 marzo 2000)”) states´Every participant of the Planning Conference for the Regional/Urban planning must share their data with rules compliant to “Atto di indirizzo e coordinamento tecnico per l'attuazione della L.R. 20 (Direttiva A-27)”” Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been transposed into Italian legislation by Decreto Legislativo 19 agosto 2005, n. 195, ""Attuazione della direttiva  003/4/CE sull'accesso del pubblico all'informazione ambientale"". Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI has been implemented by the Act of 24 January 2006, n. 36, ""Attuazione della direttiva 2003/98/ce relativa al riutilizzo di documenti nel settore pubblico"". The Codex for Digital Administration (Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale), previously mentioned, was then updated to be consistent with the implementation of the PSI Directive. 


The Codex foresees, in a generalized way, that any data managed by a public administration, with limited exceptions and whilst respecting personal data protection rules and for reasons of public security and national defense , can be accessed and re-used by any other public administration for the execution of their tasks, and this without any costs (excepted if ""exceptional costs"" may occur). However, Article 9, paragraph 8 states that data ""may"" be in a form preventing their re-use for commercial purposes. Paragraph 8 foresees the possibility of derogating from the free data and services offered and ensures that public authorities may, for reasons of self-funding, ensure access on payment of fees from users. Art. 10 states guaranteed free access, exchange and then re-use of environmental data and related services between public authorities , without new or increased burden on public finances, precluding any limitation and obstacle to let this happen. For spatial data sets  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Italy K.U.Leuven (SADL) 25 already acquired, the date of entry into force of the decrete, under conditions of license, public authorities are authorized to provide data sets and services provided for the second license. 


Even here, however, it is possible to derogate from the gratuity and, through appropriate orders to be issued, public authorities can be authorized to levy charges for the provision of spatial data to other public authorities. The European Commission made a complaint against Italy by a letter of formal notice for not transposing the directive correctly. Early 2010, the Italian authorities announced changes to the law, in order to make it compliant with the directive. The law is currently under consideration by the Parliament. The decree of the Director of the “Agenzia del Territorio” : decree November 13th, 2007 is available on the website of DigitPA at URL <http://www.digitpa.gov.it/sites/default/files/normativa/Decreto%2013_11_2007.pdf>


states that the cadastral database, including administrative, cadastral, graphic and map information related to all cadastral parcels, are made available to Public Administrations. The decree defines the way Public Administrations can use cadastral data in accordance with the laws on privacy and on the re-use of data and cadastral information. Access to cadastral data is free of charge, except for exceptional costs if any related to the implementation and supply of special services related to special needs. 


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Italian Copyright Act of 1941 has been amended several times throughout the years. The Database Directive 96/9/EC was implemented into Italian law by Decree no. 169 of 6 May 1999. Legislative Decree No. 68 of 9 April 2003 has implemented Community Directive No. 2001/29 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. The Decree came into force on 29 April 2003. No copyright exists in the texts of official acts of the state or public administrations (e.g. laws and judicial decisions). The State and local government can however be copyright owners of works created and published under their name, account and at their expense. But it only enjoys a 20-year period of protection on its own creations. The state may of course renounce the right to royalties if it wishes to assure maximum public access. Photographs that are original are subject to normal copyright. All other photographs are covered by article 88 of the Copyright Act. The photographer has the exclusive right to reproduce, publish and sell the photographs taken by him or her. The exploitation right on non-original photographs lasts twenty years after production.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Italian Data Protection Act of 1993 was updated by Act no. 675 of 31 December 1996 (Tutela delle persone e di altri soggetti rispetto al trattamento dei dati personali) to comply with European Directive 95/46/EC. This Act entered into force on 8 May 1997.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Italy K.U.Leuven (SADL) 26 Italy has transposed Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications in 2003."

Before the INSPIRE directive, Latvia had already been working on the establishment of a legal framework for geographic information for a couple of years. However, before the adoption of the law implementing the INSPIRE directive, an earlier draft Law on Geospatial Information was attempted, but this was never adopted because no final agreement could be reached between the organizations involved. The Law on the State Land Service was adopted in 1992, and adapted by the Cabinet of Ministers Order No.674 “On Reorganisation of the State Land Service” of October 18, 2005. As a result, the geodesy and cartography function was taken over by the Latvia GeoInformatic Agency (LGIA), and the surveying work was delegated to a new public limited company – Latvian State Surveyor. Currently, the operation of the SLS is regulated by the regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 439 “Regulations on the State Land Service” of May 30, 2006. SLS has many agreements on data exchange with several public institutions, such as the Ministry of the Interior, the State Forest Service, the Construction, Energy, and Housing State Agency, the Register of Enterprises, the Central Statistical Bureau, the Centre of Emergency and Disaster Medicine, the Electronic Communication Office, the State Education Development Agency and the Environment, Geology and Meteorology Agency, the Population Register of the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs, the state agency “Latvian Geospatial Information Agency” and the State Inspection for Heritage Protection. Agreements also exist with more than 400 local governments. 


On December 1, 2005, the Parliament reviewed in the final reading and adopted the Law on the State Cadastre of Real Properties as proposed by the experts of the SLS, thus completing the process of more than ten years of drafting a law that would ensure the coordinated administrative, organisational and technical functioning of the State Cadastre of Real Properties and would enable obtaining, registration, maintenance and use of updated textual and spatial data. Pursuant to the Law on State Administration, the state and local government institutions may cooperate both on a specific occasion or permanent bases signing interdepartmental agreements or cooperation agreements. This cooperation model is applied also to ensure permanent cooperation for shared use of geospatial information. Thus, for instance, Latvian Geographic Information Agency has signed an interdepartmental agreement with State Land Survey on the exchange of geographic information, the Ministry of Defence has signed an interdepartmental agreement with the Ministry of Interior for regular delivery of geographic information to bodies reporting to the Ministry of Interior, the Latvian Geographic Information Agency has signed a cooperation agreement with the Rural Support Service for delivering up-to-date geographic information enabling a unified administration of Single Area Payments, and the State Land Survey has signed separate interdepartmental agreements with other government institutions enabling the data provision from the National real estate cadastral information system. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Latvia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 The Ministry of Defence is involved in developing the Cabinet Regulations on the mandatory content of regulations governing the use of geographic data sets and procedures for obtaining a permit. These Cabinet Regulations intend to introduce the use of  licences enabling government or local authorities to perform all activities related to geographic data necessary for performing their tasks and functions and to simplify and fasten the permits delivery. These Regulations are binding on government as well as local authorities and enterprises designated as holders of geographic data sets and promote the shared use of these resources. The Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government Affairs has prepared Regulations regarding the national geoportal (not approved as yet) which will be used as the basis for organising the cooperation between the administrator of the geoportal and holders of the geographic data sets in order to ensure the availability of these data sets and metadata at the geoportal. 


A true legal framework for the NSDI was established by the Law on Geospatial Information, which transposes the INSPIRE directive, was published on 30 December 2009 in the Official Journal and entered into force on 13 January 2010. The law is broader than INSPIRE and is considered as the national law for geodesy, cartography and geospatial information. This law has completely transposed the provisions of the INSPIRE directive and established basic principles for obtaining, maintaining and using geographic information, specifying, for instance, provisions for mandatory storage of metadata for spatial data sets, standard regulations for the use of spatial data sets indicating the most significant national geospatial reference data, etc. The law contains numerous delegations to cabinet regulations that are necessary to ensure that the implementation of the national spatial data infrastructure is technically successful. The majority of these regulations are to be complete by 2011.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There is a cooperation between public and private organizations. For instance, it was intended to create the national geoportal in cooperation with the private sector which should be operational in 2012.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


The law on Freedom of Information was adopted by the Saiema (Parliament) in October 1998 and signed by the State President in November 1998. It guarantees public access to all information in “any technically feasible form” not specifically restricted by law. Information can only be withheld if specifically provided by a statute; e.g. information for internal use of an institution; commercial secrets; information about the private life of an individual, certification, examination, project, tender and similar evaluation procedures. Individuals may use it to obtain their own records. Latvia has transposed both Directive 2003/4 on the access to environmental information and Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI. The transposition of the PSI directive was done by an  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Latvia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 amendment of the Freedom of Information Act, which entered into force in October 2006. This act was complemented by Cabinet Regulation No. 940 “Regulation on the Charged Services of Information Provision”, and Cabinet Regulation No. 338 “The Procedure of Granting an Exclusive Right to Reuse of Information and Publication of Information on Granting of Such Right”.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Latvian Government has joined the Bern Convention and signed the TRIPS Agreement in 1998. Major intellectual property protection legislation is in effect since 1993. A new copyright act dates from 2000 and is in force since 2002. The current law corresponds with WIPO Copyright, TRIPS, and the European directive on the legal protection of databases. The Directive of 2001 regarding copyright in the information society was implemented into the Latvian Copyright Act by the Statutory Instrument No. 16 of 2004 [European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights)] Regulations 2004. The law is in force since 22 April 2004. The term of copyright protection is seventy years after the author’s death, while database protection is granted for fifteen years after the database is formed. Geographical maps, plans, sketches, and moulded works which relate to geography, topography and other sciences, are explicitly mentioned as protected works. During the transposition of the INSPIRE directive, the intellectual property rights on geographic data and the related exceptions were considered to be most problematic. With the help of the Ministry of Culture, a solution was found, and the intellectual property rights of geographic data owners will be governed according to the Copyright law. 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Article 96 of the Latvian Constitution explicitly recognizes the right to privacy by stating that everyone has the inviolable right to private life, home and correspondence. Article 17 of the Constitutional Law on Rights and Obligations of a Citizen and a Person secures the privacy of communications subject only to a judge’s order. A law on data protection was adopted by the Parliament on 23 March 2000. It is based on the EU directive on the processing of personal data and the Council of Europe Convention nr. 108. Latvia has implemented Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications with a framework of regulations. Latvia is a member of the Council of Europe and signed the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data on 11 February 2000. It has signed and ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.


**Licensing framework**


The general rules for data sharing in the Law on Geospatial information have not been developed into licensing policies yet. During 2010, rules of the Cabinet of Ministers were developed that serve as a background for the development of a common approach to data sharing in Latvia. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Latvia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 Licensing of datasets provided by SLS is based on individual contracts. Data, including cadastral data and the national address registry, is available to any interested person, taking into account privacy requirements. They are distributed on paper and in digital form. Some data are available freely on the website of the SLS, while for larger data sets a subscription agreement has to be arranged with SLS. Other examples of access and licensing policies can be found in the Agriculture Data Centre, the Land Parcel Identification Register, the State Register of Forests, the State Fire and Rescue Service, and Latvian Geographic Information Agency."

Since the mid-90s, there have been significant developments to develop a legal framework related to GI, including e.g. legislation establishing the registers on land and property (1996) and the responsibilities of NSGC (1997); legislation on the State registers (1996) and the population census (1997). A milestone for the development of GIS in Lithuania was the “Law on Geodesy and Cartography” which was adopted in 2001. The purpose of this law is to regulate the management of geodetic, topographic, and cartographic activities; the principles of creating databases of the GI systems and their integrity; the ownership of the geodetic control and cartographic material; and the main rights and duties of state and municipal institutions and enterprises involved in map production, geodetic survey, gathering of data, its record keeping, and use in the field of geodesy and cartography.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 During 2007 – 2010, a new version of the Law on Geodesy and Cartography was prepared which includes the transposition of the INSPIRE directive and Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market. The new law contains a definition of the Lithuanian SDI (LISI), and regulates public access to spatial data and services (unless other legislation applies). On 27 April 2010, the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania amended the (new) Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Geodesy and Cartography establishing the procedure for access to spatial data via the Lithuanian spatial information portal (LSIP). This law supplements the previous version of the Law with provisions on the use of LISI and LSIP. It covers the following issues:


- LISI spatial data themes;


- LSI portal regulations;


- LISP safety regulations;


- Security rules for the LSIP-management of digital information


- Continuity of LSIP activities


- LISI technical requirements


- Procedure for preparing and providing LISI metadata


- Procedures for monitoring LISI anr preparing/submitting reports to the European Commission.


The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Geodesy and Cartography defines the following conditions for the use and supply of spatial data sets via the LSIP:


- Access to spatial data via the Lithuanian spatial information portal must be public, unless access to spatial data is otherwise defined in other laws.


- Spatial data sets and services needed by European Union authorities, public authorities and municipalities for carrying out public tasks or submitting reports in accordance with uropean Union environmental legislation must be provided free of charge.


- State cadastre and register management bodies as well as state and municipal authorities managing spatial data sets have the right to restrict access to spatial data sets via the LSIP if this is written in other laws.


- Users of the spatial data sets and services of LISI must agree to the conditions established by spatial data and service suppliers or their authorised distributors.


- Spatial data set suppliers may be state cadastre and register management bodies or state or municipal authorities managing spatial data sets. Persons wishing to create value-added products using data from state cadastres, registers, georeferenced spatial data sets or spatial data sets and thematic spatial data sets must be entitled to do so in accordance with the procedure established by spatial data set suppliers. Value-added products must be supplied to users by authorised distributors in accordance with the procedure established by spatial data set suppliers.


- In accordance with the procedure set in legal acts, access to spatial data sets and/or services via the LSIP must be provided to Member States’ public authorities and enterprises and organisations that provide public services.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20


- Regarding payment services, the service provider must ensure that users from the Republic of Lithuania and other Member States are able to use e-commerce services. During the LIGI project, GIS-Centras prepared typical documents describing the conditions of supply and use of spatial data in Lithuania:


1. Agreements on the granting of distribution rights on spatial data products and on supply of spatial data products to the LISI. This is an agreement between the LSIP manager and a spatial data supplier. It presents the main terms, the legal basis of provision of spatial data and services via LSIP, the procedure for distributing spatial data services, the data supplier payment, the rights and obligations of the parties as well as the general procedure for providing spatial data and services to users. The annexes of the agreement contain structured forms with explanations for entering the descriptors of spatial data or services provided.


2. Model agreements on the use of spatial data and services. They set the main conditions for using spatial data and services based on which the LSIP manager makes licence agreements with the end users of spatial data and services. They provide for methods of approving licence agreements by a physical signature, electronic signature and clicking upon checking the person’s identity. The licence agreement sets the procedures for providing spatial data and related services to users, the purpose and conditions for use as well as the payment procedure.


3. Conditions for using LSIP-services. These services are publicly applicable and free of charge. They are constructed more simply than licence agreements. Finally, the Ministry of Agriculture and National Land Service under the Ministry of Agriculture (NLS) are responsible for a strategy implementing INSPIRE in Lithuania. There are some internal planning documents, which are used for communication to state data stakeholders and responsible authorities, but those documents are not approved as legal acts.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


There are no real PPPs established in the domain of spatial data infrastructures in the Republic of Lithuania.


**Policy and legislation on access to and re-use of public sector information (PSI)**


On 2 July 1996 the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public (no. I-1418) was passed. The latest amendment to this law was made in July 2006. Article 6 of this law states that “Every individual shall have the right to obtain from State and local authority institutions and agencies and other budgetary institutions, public information regarding their activities, their official documents (copies), as well as private information about himself” and “State and local government institutions must, in accordance with the procedure established by the Law On the Right to Obtain Information from State and Local Government Institutions and other laws, furnish public information as well as  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 21 private information held by them, except in instances specified by laws, when private information is not to be divulged.” A version on the Law on State Registers has been in force since August 2004. The state registers are an important part of official public information. Currently the Law affects to more than 90 databases. In the near future this number of registers could increase to around 160. The law on State Registers defines the order of establishing, creation, managing, liquidation and distribution of the state registers. All data of the state registers are public and available for any citizen or legal person if it is not restricted by other specific laws. The data are available via Internet or could be downloaded by data flow channels. There is no standard license. The details of the distribution of the data of every register are described in the regulations of the register adopted by a Government Decree. The list of registers is available at [www.registrai.lt](http://www.registrai.lt/). Lithuania has transposed Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information.


Directive 2003/98 was transposed by the law of 10 November 2005 on Obtaining Information from Central and Local Government Institutions (Nr. X-383 of 10 November 2005). The law concerns the right of private companies and citizens to obtain information from central and local government and the re-use of it. The law defines the rights and modalities to use the information resources of public sector and also determines the obligation of central and local government to provide this kind of information to all concerned. There are currently no valid official agreements.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Law on Copyright and Related Rights (Act no. VIII-1185) was enacted on 18 May 1999, entering into force on 9 June 1999 (amendments were introduced by the Act of 20 July 2000 - no. VIII-1886). The Copyright Act was a major step forward for the legal regime in Lithuania. It was drafted taking into consideration the EU directives and provisions of the Bern and Geneva Conventions. In the last decade Lithuania has transformed its copyright law from the old Soviet-style one into a system that complies to a large extent with modern bilateral and multilateral standards. Chapter 4 of the Copyright Law contains special provisions on the legal protection of databases (sui generis right). The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society has been incorporated in Lithuanian legislation. Article 34 of the recent Law on Geodesy and Cartography of June 2001 contains special provisions regarding the copyright protection of GI. This article stipulates the following:


“The Republic of Lithuania shall be the copyright holder of the exclusive economic rights to official maps and digital databases financed from the state budget and foreign assistance for the Republic of Lithuania. The authorised institution shall, within the limits of its competence, administer the exclusive economic rights of the authors to official maps and georeferenced databases.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 22 The municipalities shall be the copyright holders of the exclusive economic rights of the authors to topographic maps, plans and georeferenced databases financed from the municipal budgets and shall, within the limits of their competence, administer the exclusive economic rights of the authors. For the use of official maps and georeferenced databases, publishing of thematic maps or development of institutional digital databases, with the exception of their use for defence needs, an author's fee shall be charged and a copyright licensing agreement shall be made with the user. The remuneration received as the author's fee shall be used for adjustment of official maps and georeferenced databases. The rights to cartographic works, thematic and other maps and databases shall be protected following the procedure under law. Original works of thematic cartography shall be regarded as research work and their publication shall be recognised as scientific publications.” Closely linked to article 34 are the stipulations made in article 7 on the ownership of geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials. Article 35 stipulates with regard to the procedure on the use of geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials: “Geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials and georeferenced data shall be public and available to any natural and legal persons and enterprises without the status of a legal person. The authorised institution and executive institutions of the municipalities shall provide to the consumers geodetic, topographic and cartographic materials and georeferenced data following the procedure established by the authorised institution and executive institutions of the municipalities. Fees for the materials and data shall be charged in the manner stipulated by laws.”


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Lithuania enacted its Law on Legal Protection of Personal Data in 1996. This law has been amended several times throughout the years. The latest amendment dates from 22 January 2002, as to ensure the compliance of the act with the EU Directives on data protection. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications still has been transferred into national law. The Law on the Public Registers of 13 August 1996 (no. I-1490) determines the rights and duties of the institutions responsible for the management of public registers, the institutions directing their activities and exercising supervision over them, the rights and duties of the legal and natural persons providing data to the public registers as well as using the data of public registers, and the protection of these rights. It also determines the rights and duties of legal and natural persons whose data constitutes the object of the public registers and the protection of said rights. Referring to article 23, section 4 of the Law on Geodesy and Cartography public institutions, responsible for administration of state registers, cadastres, state and EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Lithuania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 23 municipal institutions, responsible for management of spatial datasets have rights to limit an access to spatial datasets via LSIP if such described in other laws.


**Licensing data framework**


The Law on Geodesy and Cartography lists a number of geodetic, topographic and cartographic activities that should be carried out. These activities are subject to licensing, and the licences for these activities shall be issued by the National Land Service. The National Land Service arranges the concession of licences for cadastral survey products, topography, geodesy and cartography activities. It administers the funds provided for these purposes. Regarding LSIP, data sets are available under a licensing policy that allows a large part of the procedure to be performed in an automated way (see section 2.3.1). Standard agreements and licences are developed for different groups of stakeholders, with a description of the use conditions. LSIP lists the terms and conditions of the use of the data. It also presents the privacy statements describing the LSIP usage in general. Each spatial data set or service in LSIP is delivered to the end user by signing a licence agreement. Signing can be achieved in several ways: analogue (physical) signature, electronic signature or accepting license conditions on-line."					Wednesday, June 15, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

The legal framework for the Luxembourg SDI is very limited. The cadastre was organised mainly by the “Loi du 21 juin 1973 portant organisation de l'Administration du Cadastre et de la Topographie” and a number of subsequent regulations (<http://www.act.public.lu/fr/legislation/index.html>). A reorganisation was put in place by the law of 25 July 2002. In June 2010, the European Commission decided to take Luxembourg to the European Court of Justice for infringement of its obligation to transpose the directive (<http://ec.europa.eu/community_law/eulaw/decisions/dec_20100603.htm>). Shortly after, the INSPIRE Directive was transposed into national law: Loi du 26/07/2010 portant transposition de la directive 2007/2/CE du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 14 mars 2007 établissant une infrastructure d’information géographique dans la Communauté européenne (INSPIRE) en droit national4.

**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information (PSI)**


There is no general freedom of information law in Luxembourg. Under the 1960 Decree on state archives, the archives are to be open to the public, but people must make a written request explaining why they want access and ministers have broad discretion to deny requests. Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information was transposed by the Law of 25 November regarding public access to environmental information (Loi du 25 novembre 2005 concernant l’accès du public à l’information en matière d’environnement, <http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/2005/2041912/2041912.pdf?SID=143d7626b0a51f7399c30822b3562e8c#page=2>). Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information was transposed by the Law of 4 December 2007 (<http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/docs/laws/luxembourg/lux_law_2007.pdf>).

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Luxemburg Copyright Act dates from 2001 and was modified in March 2004. It protects literary and artistic works, including photographs, databases and computer programs. Article 10 of the Copyright Law determines that official texts of the authorities, including their official translations, shall not give rise to copyright. This also includes the preliminary works, court decisions and political discussions. All other writings produced by the State, municipalities or public establishments shall give rise to copyright for a term of 70 years. There are no special regulations regarding the protection of geographical information. The Copyright Act transposes the 1996 directive on databases and the 2001 directive on copyright in the information society into Luxemburg law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Luxemburg Data Protection Law was adopted in 2002, in order to implement the European Data Protection Directive of 1995. In 2007, it was amended for the last time. The 2002 directive on privacy and electronic communications was transposed by the Law on Privacy in Electronic Communications"" of May 30, 2005 (Loi du 30 mai 2005 relative aux dispositions spécifiques de protection de la personne à l'égard du traitement des données à caractère personnel dans le secteur des communications électroniques).


**Licensing framework**


In March 2009, two regulations were adopted that regulate the conditions for access and delivery of cadastral data and cartographic, topographic and geodetic data (Règlement grand-ducal du 9 mars 2009 portant fixation des conditions et modalités de deliverance de la documentation cadastrale and Règlement grand-ducal du 9 mars 2009 portant fixation des modalités de mise à disposition et des tarifs des produits cartographiques, topographiques et géodésiques de l’administration du cadastre et de la topographie – see <http://www.act.public.lu/fr/legislation/diffusion-donnees/index.html>).


Cadastral extracts can be delivered digitally or on paper. Any reproduction of the data should mention the source and the date of validity. Digital data have to be requested in writing and the public authorities have to state the task in the public interest for which they need the data. Other natural or legal persons do not need to state an interest; they should only make a request in writing. For obtaining topographic, cartographic and geodetic data, an agreement has to be signed between the user and the administration fixing the details of delivery and the price. The rights of use are determined in the regulation. A distinction is made between different  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Luxembourg K.U.Leuven (SADL) 16 types of use: internal use, external use by disseminating the data to contractors, reproduction of the data. The Luxembourgish Law stipulates that the data can be shared free of charge between all the public authorities. A set of non-secured OGC-compliant webservices (WMS/WFS) are available to all the people having access to the state network. Community institutions and bodies can access the data available in the LSDI through Webservices that can be opened case by case. Once a convention has been signed and a price fixed for the access to the data, Community institutions and bodies can access the data by using a HTTP BASIC login to the OGC compliant WMS / WFS services. Even if most of the data is not free of charge speaking in terms of download services, all the data can be viewed and queried free of charge in the geoportal’s viewer(S),"					Wednesday, June 15, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The 2000 Copyright Act “to make new provision in respect of copyright and neighbouring rights and certain “sui generis” intellectual property rights in substitution of the provisions of the Copyright Act, Cap. 196” was amended in 2001 and 2003. It explicitly protects maps, plans, diagrams and three-dimensional works relative to geography, science or topography. Article 25 of the Copyright Act provides for a sui generis right in respect to databases. Regarding the copyright works of government and international bodies, article 6 of the Copyright Act stipulates that copyright shall be conferred by this article on every work which is eligible for copyright and which is made by or under the direction or control of the Government of Malta and also such governments of other States, international bodies


or other intergovernmental organisations as may be prescribed by the Minister responsible for the Industrial Property Office. The 2001 Directive on copyright in the information society was included in the Copyright act by the amendments of 2003.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The Maltese Data Protection Act of 2001 came into force on 22 March 2002 and was amended in July 2003. It includes the rules prescribed by Directive 95/46 on the processing of personal data, and the 2002 Directive on privacy and electronic communications.


**Licensing framework**


Licenses are issued for certain data and services. In 2007, the National Mapping Agency has reviewed its licence fees within the Public Sector (the review was repeated in 2008 and 2009). This coincided with a shift towards a single contractual arrangement for each ministry, thus enabling a more cost effective, relationship for departments and entities within the respective Ministry’s portfolio. To support this initiative, MEPA has detailed its digital mapping product sets, and associated licence fees, in a manner which provides for easier, centralised, contracting in close liaison with a Ministry’s representative. Agreements with the Ministry of Health, the Elderly and Community Care (MHEC) and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Employment (MEYE) have already been signed.

The process of establishing SNIG (Sistema Nacional de Informação Geográfica) started in February 1986, with the publication of decision SEIC 2/86 of the Secretary of State for Research and Development. It created a task force -consisting of the representatives of the main actors in the GI area- whose mission was to study the creation of a national SDI and to propose to the Secretary of State the corresponding actions to be taken by the Government. As a result of the studies and activities carried out by this task force, the Portuguese SNIG was created in 1990 through Decree-Law no. 53/90. This law also established the CNIG (Centro Nacional de Informação Geográfica) as a governmental EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Portugal K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 research centre with the mission of coordinating and implementing the SNIG (CNIGwebsiteis no longer online). Since its inception, the SNIG was intended to become the focal point of geospatial data distribution and accessibility in Portugal. It was conceived as a fully distributed system consisting of nodes that serve data or metadata online, and was launched on the Internet in May 1995.


In 2001 the Portuguese government -in order to improve the efficiency of the public administration- decided to create the Instituto Geográfico Português (IGP) by merging CNIG with IPCC (Portuguese National Geodetic, Mapping and Cadastre Agency). The IGP was created in January 2002 and its organic law published by the Decree-Law no. 53/2002. The transposition of the INSPIRE directive was embedded in the revision of the existing law 53-90 on the SNIG (DL - Decreto-Lei n.º 180/2009, 7 August 2009, <http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2009/08/15200/0513205139.pdf>).


The same Decree-Law nr. 180/2009 created the National Registry for Geographic Information and provided the set-up of the Advisory Council of the National Geographic Information System (CO-SNIG) responsible for the coordination of the INSPIRE implementation.


It should be noted that Azores and Madeira are autonomous regions developing their own SDs: IDEiA (Azores) and IRIG-Madeira. 


**Public-private partnerships (PPP’s)**


No information available. 


For the SDS of Portuguese maritime heritage, cooperation has been established with private and public, local and national bodies, in particular collaboration arrangements with the Centre for Overseas History (CHAM/UNL), the Labour and Business Sciences Institute (ISCTE) and theTropical and Scientific Research Institute (IICT). 


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


Article 268 of the Constitution determines that citizens shall enjoy the right to have access to administrative records and files, subject to the legal provisions with respect to internal and external security, investigation of crime and personal privacy. Law no. 65/93 (Lei de Acesso aos Documentos Administrativos) of 26 August 1993 (as amended by Law no. 8/95 of 29 March 1995 and by Law no. 94/99 of 16 July 1999) provides for this access to government records. The law is overseen by the Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (Comissão de Acesso aos Documentos Administrativos), an independent parliamentary agency. This Commission can examine complaints, give opinions on access, and decide on classification of systems (http://www.cada.pt). EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Portugal K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 Directive 2003/4 on access to environmental information has been transposed into Portuguese law by Law 19/2006 of 19 June 2006 ([http://www.cada.pt/uploads/7f000001- a20b-9451.pdf](http://www.cada.pt/uploads/7f000001-%20a20b-9451.pdf)). Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of PSI was transposed by Law 46/2007 of 24 August 2007


(<http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/docs/laws/portugal/pt_transposition_law.pdf>).


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


The Portuguese Copyright Act (Code of Copyright and Related Rights no. 45/85) dates from 17 September 1985 and has been revised since. It practically lists the same works eligible for protection as the Berne Convention. This includes geographical maps and illustrations and works related to geography or other sciences. The general description of the copyrighted material is: intellectual creations in the area of literature science and art. Collections of data are not specifically mentioned. The law only speaks of works such as anthologies and encyclopaedias. It is however doubtful whether GI datasets fall within the scope of the copyright act, since they are a collection of facts and not a collection of works. For GI in the form of digital maps, it may be argued that since paper maps enjoy protection, the same should apply to digital maps. Photographic work (e.g. aerial photograph) only qualifies for copyright protection if the selection of the object to be photographed and/or the way in which it is made, results in a personal artistic creation. Photography that is the basis for map production will in general not meet these demands. This does not necessarily mean that the map that results from the photography is not protected. The law on the production of products of cartography (Law no. 193/95 of 28 July 1995) states explicitly that copyright law applies to cartographic information. Notwithstanding copyright protection (for which originality is one of the requirements), article 14 sub 2 of this new law states that it is forbidden to use, supply to others, reproduce, divulge or commercialize cartographic products or the corresponding technical data without permission of the entity of which it is the property. It is clear that this law aims to give producers of GI additional protection besides copyright. By Decree Law 122/2000 of 4 July 2000 the EU Directive on the protection of databases was implemented into Portuguese law. The 2001 directive on copyright in the information society has also been transposed into Portuguese law.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


The system for access to personal information is regulated by both the Constitution (articles 37, 48 and 268 of the Constitution) and the law. Law no. 67/98 on the Protection of Personal Data of 26 October 1998 implements Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The supervisory authority is the National Data Protection Commission (Comissão Nacional de Protecção de Dados - http://www.cnpd.pt). The  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Portugal K.U.Leuven (SADL) 20 applicability of the above privacy legislation to the processing of GI depends largely on the interpretation of the concept of “personal data”. The 2002 Directive on privacy and electronic communications has been implemented in Portuguese law.


**Licensing framework**


Data sharing arrangements exist between public authorities and they differ accordingly their object and conditions like - data-sharing and collaboration agreements between public authorities e.g within the Regional Geographic Information Infrastructure (IRIG), the Regional Directorate for Geographic Information and Regional Planning Madeira has collaboration agreements with all the Municipalities and a large number of regional and national GI producers; - agreements in which information production costs are shared;- licences to use information; - information sharing arrangements with private bodies;


- data-sharing arrangements through Geo Web Services; e.g. Agriculture and Fisheries Financing Institute has Data-sharing arrangements via Web Services with the Vine and Wine Institute, with the Management Authority of the Rural Development Programme for the Mainland and with various insurers (harvest insurance);


- information exchange arrangements on certain themes;


- data model definition arrangements;


- application transfer arrangements;


- GI and tool transfer arrangements


Data from the IGP can be requested by filling out a standard form provided on the website (<http://www.igeo.pt/Frameset-egeo.htm>). Sometimes when the ownership of the data is shared between IGP and another public organization, the use by third parties is regulated by a pre-established protocol. For the Soil and Soil Capacity of Use Maps (1:25 000), public authorities have to sign a Term of Responsibility, emitted by the Direcção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DGADR), to be able to use that cartography. DGADR has different levels of charging for different users (e.g. public authorities with cooperation agreements, university and research, private companies, students)."

The ""Law of Cadastre and Real Estate Publicity"" (law no. 7/1996) regulates the activities in the domains of cadastre, geodesy and cartography and founded ANCPI, which is organized according to Government Decree No.1038/1996 and its subsequent modifications (Romanian Government Decree No. 98/1999). EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Romania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 13 The organisation and functioning of ANCPI, the National Agency for Cadastre and Land Registration, is regulated by Government Decision No 1210/2004 of 29 July 2004. The Decision defines ANCPI as a public institution, with legal personality. It is the single authority in the area of cadastre, geodesy, topography, photogrammetry and mapping, and subordinated to the Ministry of Administration and the Interior. In 2005, the emergency governmental ordinance No. 95/2005 laid the responsibility for the establishment of the national environmental spatial infrastructure for policy making with the national central public authority responsible for environmental management. In 2010, the INSPIRE directive was implemented by Government Ordinance nr. 4/2010 establishing the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (INIS). Through this order the coordinating body for INIS is established, i.e. the INIS Council (CINIS). In one of the annexes (4) the responsibles for the coordinating and collaborating public bodies of the INIS Council are listed. Government Ordinance nr 4/2010 also defines the roles and tasks of each of the participating bodies.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


In Romania, the PPP model is gaining importance in the form that ANCPI is the public body with overall responsibility and the private firms perform the bulk of the surveying/map production under contract (Geolink Consulting, Ltd, Romania: National Spatial Data Infrastructure and INSPIRE).


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The “Act on the Free Access to the Information of Public Interest” of 12 October 2001 allows individuals to request public information held by government departments and requires government departments to respond to requests and provide information about their activities within 30 days. Governmental Decision no. 878/2005 on public access to environmental information implements EU Directive 2003/4/EC (<http://www.apador.org/en/legi/hot_1115_2002_e.rtf>). Directive 2003/98 on the re-use of public sector information was transposed by the Law of 25 April 2007 (<http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/docs/laws/romania/law_april_2007.pdf>


).


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


In 1996 Romania adopted a modern Copyright Law that went into force on 24 June 1996 (Law no. 8 of 14 March 1996). It explicitly protects three-dimensional works, maps and drawings in the field of topography, geography and science in general. EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Romania K.U.Leuven (SADL) 14 Article 9 of the Copyright Act states that official texts of a political, legislative, administrative or judicial nature, and official translations thereof, do not benefit from the legal protection accorded to copyright. Article 122 of the Copyright Act was amended to implement, directive 96/9 on database protection, as part of the effort to bring the Romanian legislation in line with the acquis communautaire.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Art. 26 of the 1991 Constitution states:"" §(1) The public authorities shall respect and protect the intimate, family, and private life. §(2) Any natural person has the right to freely dispose of information on himself unless by this he causes an infringement upon the rights and freedoms of others, on public order, or morals."" Romania implemented directive 95/46 and enacted on 21 November 2001 Law no. 677 regarding the data protection (Data Protection Act) (OJ, Part I, no. 790 of 12 December 2001); and in 2005 Law no. 102/2005 regarding the setting up, organisation and functioning of the National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing.

The legal framework on GI in Slovakia is determined by a number of different laws and decrees. The most important Acts include 


1. Act No. 162/1995 on the Real Estate Cadastre and the Entries of Ownership and Other Rights to the Real Estates (The Cadastre Act) as amended by the Act No. 222/1996 Coll., the Act No. 255/2001 Coll., the Act No. 419/2002 Coll. and the Act No. 173/2004 Coll.


 2. Act No. 215/1995 on Geodesy and Cartography as amended by the Act No. 423/2003 Coll and the Act 346/2007. In this Act, the Primary Database for Geographic Information System is considered to be the core geo-referenced data set for building the State Information System by the public authorities. In this legislation the following issues are dealt with: maintenance, liability, funding and the obligations imposed on users and producers. By the amendment of 2003, an institutional framework that brings together the government, the government institutions and the local administrations, was starting to be developed. In 2007, the Act was amended to implement the requirements of the PSI directive.


 3. Decree of GCCA No. 79/1996 by which the Act No. 162/1995 on the Real Estate Cadastre and the Entries of Ownership and Other Rights to the Real Estates (The Cadastre Act) is executed as amended the Decree No. 72/1997 Coll. , the Decree No. 533/2001 Coll. and the Decree No. 467/2004 Coll.

5. Act No. 275/2006 on Information Systems of Public Administration.


 6. The Act No. 205/2004 on collecting and disseminating environmental information and on amendment and supplementation of certain acts. 


7. Act No. 3/2010 transposing the INSPIRE directive. The responsibility for the transposition was assigned to the Ministry of Environment by Decision 845/2007 of the Slovak government from 3 October 2007


 8. Government decree of the Slovak Republic No. 540/2002 establishing the Cadastral Portal, which enables authorized access to land registry data via the Internet. The INSPIRE Directive has been transposed into Slovak law by Act No 3/2010 on the National Infrastructure for Spatial Information (the NISI Act – NIPI in Slovak), which entered into force on 1 February 2010. The INSPIRE technical implementing rules are EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Slovak Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 17 directly applicable. Act No 215/1995 on geodesy and cartography, as amended, which is implemented by Decree of the Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre Authority of the Slovak Republic No 300/2009 defines standards like the parameters of binding coordinate systems and localisation standards for maps.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


PPPs are quite common practice in the Slovak Republic, especially in the sectors of building industry, architecture and others. In the GI-sector the PPPs are considered to be very useful in the development of an SDI. In the Slovak Republic PPP has mainly been applied in the next areas:


 all geodetic surveys for a creation of survey sketches for the GCCA purposes,


 Land Title Consolidation (ROEP) for the GCCA purposes,


 Land Consolidation Project for the GCCA purposes and realization of the


Land Consolidation for the purposes of the Ministry of Agriculture SR,


 aerial photos for the purposes of the Ministry of Agriculture SR – system IACS A number of private companies have formed the Slovak Association for Geoinformatics (SAGI), of which the mission is to support the use and development of geographic information in Slovak Republic, including geographic information systems, remote sensing and related fields. **Policy and legislation on access to public sector information (PSI)**


The right of access to PSI is implemented by the NC SR Act No. 211/2000 on the Free Access to Information of 2000, entering into force in January 2001. It sets broad rules on disclosure of information held by the public organisation. Together with the Act, a Decree of the Ministry of Finance on Calculation Costs related to the providing of Free Access to Public Information has been implemented (ePSIplus National Report Slovakia. This freedom of information legislation relates to the GI sector in general but it does not relate to the GI datasets and to the data from the Cadastre of the Real Estates, which cannot be obtained on the basis of the Free Access to Information law. The transposition of directive 2003/98/EC on re-use of PSI was transposed by an amendment of this Act in August 2005, and by an amendment to the Act on Geodesy and Cartography. Since September 2007 the Cadastral Information provides free information on Land Information System. Registered users are entitled to search the cadastre data over the whole territory of SK, on the basis of full registration and agreement concluded with the operator. Full registration is intended for authorized users such as state organs, bodies active in criminal proceedings, executors, notaries, tax offices etc., which prove a legitimate interest based on the provisions of the body of laws of the Slovak Republic.  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Slovak Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 18 Non-registered users have the right to search the cadastre data in the extent of one cadastral district.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Currently the Slovak Copyright Act is fully in line with the EU legislation. The Slovak Copyright Act (the NC SR Act No. 618/2003) based on the European Commission Database Directive 96/9/EC and Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright in the information society was implemented into Slovak legislation. Works of cartography in analogue or any other form are explicitly protected. The strategy for the SDI does not contain specific copyright provisions. The Act on the Slovak Copyright, the Act on the Budgetary Regulation, the Act on the State Information System, and the Act on the Administrative Charges are applied in this case. Most of the GI is accessible on the basis of a written contract. In the case of information supply via the Internet, a click-use license is considered to be a valid agreement. Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy Since the year 1998 the legal protection of privacy has been enacted in the SR legal framework (the NC SR Act No. 52/1998). The Act on the Protection of Personal Data was approved in July 2002 (the NC SR Act No. 428/2002). It limits the conditions of the collection, disclosure and use of the personal information by government agencies and private enterprises either in electronic or analogue form. It specifies the duties of access, the accuracy and the correction, security, and confidentiality on the data processor. The Act also created an Office for Personal Data Protection to supervise and enforce the Act. The legal protection of privacy is incorporated into the Act on the Real Estate Cadastre and Entries for Ownership and Other Rights to the Real Estates and in the Act on Geodesy and Cartography. The specific provisions in relation to privacy contain forbiddance to publish the personal identification numbers on-line. Directive 2002/58 on privacy and electronic communications has been transposed into national legislation (the Act No. 610/2003).


**Licensing framework**


Measures for sharing spatial data and services can be defined as legislative, conceptual, and coordinating measures. Legislative measures:- the transposition of the INSPIRE Directive into the NISI Act Before the NISI Act came into force, data sharing was organised by means of agreements between institutions e.g. agreement between the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Slovak Republic K.U.Leuven (SADL) 19 Defence, agreement between the MoEnv SR and the Ministry of Defence, agreement between the MoEnv SR and the Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre Authority. 


Conceptual:


- approval of the National eGovernment Concept and the Concept for the Development of Information Systems for the MoEnv SR and other Ministries


- the Government Policy Statement in support of interoperability


- the preparation of special generally binding legislation – an implementing decree for the NISI Act


Coordinating measures:


- the establishment of the NISI Coordination Board – the coordination of the activities of responsible authorities


- the coordination of the work of working parties


For access to the Cadastral Portal, a difference is made between registered and nonregistered users. The former can use data from the entire territory of the country, based on an agreement. Such use is intended for users such as state organs, bodies active in criminal proceedings, executors, notaries, tax offices etc. The latter users do not have to conclude an agreement, but can only search in the extent of one cadastral district (see<https://www.katasterportal.sk/kapor/faq.do>). This is in line with the policy of the Ministry of the Environment that environmentally oriented data created with state funds should be available without restrictions, upon registration and acceptance of copyright terms (Martin Tuchyna, Establishment of spatial data infrastructure within the environmental sector in Slovak Republic, 2006)"					Wednesday, June 15, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Turkey is currently working on implementing a strategy for the NSDI and preparing a proposal for a law on the spatial data infrastructure. The Prime Ministry for State Planning and Organization proposed a number of Action Items in the course of the e-Transformation Turkey Initiative during 2005 and 2006, to prepare the set-up of the NSDI:


 Action Item 47 (A Preliminary Work to setup the National GIS / NSDI) (Dec 4, 2003 –Feb 2005): this action item included a survey of stakeholders, the identification of problems and recommendations. The study was executed by the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre, in cooperation with public bodies, universities, the private sector and the municipalities (G. Yalcin, B. Erkek, S. Bakici and N. Ahn, Through Spatial Data Infrastructure in Turkey, <http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2009/papers/ts01b/ts01b_yalcin_etal_3460.pdf>).


 Action Item 36 (Policy& Strategy Document of the National GIS/NSDI) (May 2005 –Feb 2006). The goals of this item were to determine standards for classification data, metadata, producing, storing and sharing data; to prepare a strategy document, and to determine the requirements for the legal framework. This action item led to the following SDI vision: “to allow geospatial data users in the country on-line access to quality and up-to-date geospatial information they need for their geo-related decision support processes, projects and applications”. It identified responsibilities for the different data categories, and gave recommendations on standards and metadata. It proposed an independent national Committee for NSDI, and a special SDI unit within the National Mapping and Cadastral Agency. A strategy in 6 stages was proposed:


 o STAGE 1: Realize legal regulation covering Policy, data content and organizational responsibilities for the NSDI.


 o STAGE 2: Develop the National Spatial data Exchange Standard (UVDF) in compliance with ISO standards.


 o STAGE 3: Let the institutions prepare geospatial metadata for their area of responsibility and present at their metadata portals.


o STAGE 4: Let the NSDI Organizational Infrastructure (e.g. Committee or Unit) prepare geospatial data standards according to the NSDI policy and strategy document (i.e. Action Item 36 –Report) EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Turkey K.U.Leuven (SADL) 10


o STAGE 5: Let the institutions prepare geospatial data for their area of responsibility.


o STAGE 6: Let the institutions present their data their data portals according to the legal framework defined at Stage 1.


 Action Item 75 (Creating National GIS Infrastructure/ NSDI) - (Jul 2006 –Dec 2007) was the result of the National Information Society Strategy and its Action Plan for 2006-2010. Its objective was the establishment of the Geographic Information Infrastructure. Next to these Action items, the following instruments are also important:


 Municipality Law 5216 and Metropolitan Law 5272 oblige municipalities to build GIS and urban GIS


 Interoperability circular 2005: this contains standards to build information systems in all central and local public institutions (A. Aydinoglu, W. Quak, T. Yomralioglu, Some Spatial Data Management Issues towards Building SDI,


 <http://www.i3mainz.fhmainz.de/FIGWorkshop/programme2Dateien/TS%206.2_Aydinoglu,etc._Some%20Spatial%20Data%20Management%20Issues%20towards%20Building%20SDI.pdf>)


 2005 Cadastre law: this law gives a mandate to create the Turkish NSDI.


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


PPPs between the public and the private sector for the operation of the cadastre are accepted in theory, but are not fully operational yet. The government is working together with the company Turksat to develop the Turkish SDI.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The Turkish law on the right to information dates from October 9, 2003. The object of the law is to regulate the procedure of the right to information according to the principles of equality, impartiality and openness that are the necessities of a democratic and transparent government. Next to the Act, a circular on 'The exercise of the right of petition and access to information' was issued by The Prime Ministry in 2004 (see


<http://www.epractice.eu/en/document/288415>).


The law on the right to information gives natural and legal persons the right to obtain information from public institutions and private organisations that qualify as public institutions.

**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Turkey has had a modern copyright law since 1951. It was amended in 1995 in order to harmonize it with European Union copyright principles. The amended Copyright Law contains a number of significant improvements: expanding the term of protection to 70 years, broadening coverage to include software, and sharply increasing penalties for infringement. However, further amendments are needed to bring the law into compliance with TRIPs, Berne. In 2001, the Copyright law was amended in order to make it more compliant with international conventions.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Section Five of the 1982 Turkish Constitution is entitled “Privacy and Protection of Private Life”. Article 20 of the Turkish Constitution deals with the “Privacy of the Individual’s Life”, whilst article 22 deals with the “Secrecy of communication”. The Turkish Ministry of Justice has been working on data protection legislation for several years without success. In mid 2003, a draft law on the protection of personal data (Kisisel Verilerin Korunmasi Kanunu Taslagi) was completed. It is based on the 1981 Council of Europe Convention and Directive 95/46 on the protection of personal data. The draft was sent to the National Assembly in 2008, and it is still pending (<http://www.epractice.eu/en/document/288415>). The By-law on privacy in the telecommunications sector was adopted in 2004 and the By-law on electronic communication security in 2008.

In 1999, the Law on State Survey and Real Estate Cadastre was adopted and followed by implementing rules on the procedure for topographic surveys, the production of state maps and the state geodetic administration. In addition, the Parliament adopted the State Survey and Real Property Cadastre Programme for 2001-2005. In 2007, the State Geodetic Administration prepared a new law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre (Official Gazette no. 16/2007) and new Rules and Regulations on Topographic Survey and State Map Production (Official Gazette no. 109/2008). The law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre contains a separate chapter on SDI e.g. SDI-definition, data content, necessary services, institutional framework, metadata, …).. As during the adoption procedure of the law, the draft INSPIRE directive was available, the SDI chapter of the law was attuned to some of the provisions of the directive. However, not all provisions of the directive are included in the Law yet. This will be done in a next step. The law defines the NSDI as a set of measures, standards, specifications and services within the framework of e-government for enabling the effective collection, management, exchange and usage of the geo-referenced spatial data that are subject to the law. Under the law, the bodies that are part of the NSDI are responsible for the regular maintenance of their spatial data sets and services and have an obligation to make their sets and services available to the national geoportal. The law sets up an NSDI Council, Committee and Working Groups. In May 2007, the Croatian Government appointed the 15 members and the president of the council (Official Gazette no. 16/2007).  EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Croatia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 12


**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


Topographic mapping was performed during the 1990s in cooperation with the private sector. Recently, PPPs have been developed on the basis of the law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre. A large part of the data production is outsourced to the private sector.


**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information(PSI)**


The Croatian Act on the Right of Access to Information was adopted in October 2003, on the basis of Article 88 of the Constitution. Under the Act, all information possessed, disposed of or controlled by bodies of public authorities have to be available to any interested beneficiary of the right to information. This right of access to information covers the right to seek and receive information and the obligation of public bodies to make access to the requested information possible or to publish information when there is no special request for them. Any domestic or foreign natural or legal person can obtain access to public information. Access to State Survey and the Real Property Cadastre data and documents, print-outs, aerial images and other documents is regulated separately by the law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights** 


The Copyright and Related Rights Act (O.G. 167/2003) replaced earlier legislation of 1999 and entered into force on 30 October 2003. The Act protects original intellectual creations in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, having an individual character, irrespective of the manner and form of its expression, its type, value or purpose. Photographic and cartographic works, drawings, plans, sketches and tables are explicitly protected. Copyright is excluded for official texts in the domain of legislation, administration, judiciary (acts, regulations, decisions, reports, minutes, judgments, standards, and the like) and other official works and their collections, which are published for the purpose of officially informing the public. Next to copyright, databases are also protected by a separate right of the producer of the database, in line with the provisions of the 1996 database directive.


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


Article 37 of the Croatian Constitution states that “everyone shall be guaranteed the safety and secrecy of personal data. Without consent from the person concerned, personal data may be collected, processed and used only under conditions specified by law. Protection of data and supervision of the work of information systems in the Republic EC-INSPIRE: Spatial Data Infrastructures in Europe: State of play Spring 2011 Croatia K.U.Leuven (SADL) 13 shall be regulated by law. The use of personal data contrary to the purpose of their collection shall be prohibited”  The Croatian Act on Personal Data Protection is based on the constitution and dates from 2003 (Official Gazette, no. 103/2003). It has been brought in line with the European directive 95/46/EC on the processing of personal data. Two other acts should also be mentioned:


 the Regulation on the method of maintaining records on personal data filing system and the form of such records (Official Gazette, No. 105/04); and  the Regulation on the manner of storing and special measures of technical protection of the special categories of personal data (Official Gazette, No. 139/04)


**Licensing framework**


Under the law on State Survey and Real Property Cadastre, a working group has been set up on spatial data sharing policies, with the task to coordinate, develop and maintain an interoperable and customisable licence model that allows the spatial data providers to define and publish access conditions for their data and services. Draft versions of agreements templates for data exchange between public bodies and for access and re-use by third parties are developed."					Friday, June 17, 2016	Staff_Consultant	INFO

Juli 2005 über die Gebühren für den Bezug von Daten aus der Geodateninfrastruktur Liechtenstein). The law of 19 May 2005 states that the cadastral data are the basic layers for the building the spatial data infrastructure allowing to be used for public and private purposes. A new law for the transposition of the INSPIRE has been adopted. This law regulates the development, maintenance and the organisation of the Liechtenstein SDI. The law on Geographical Information (Geoinformationsgesetz, GeoIG) was adopted by the parliament 15 December 2010 and published 1 February 2011. Together with this law, a regulation on Geographical Information (Geoinformationsverordnung, GeoIV) was adopted 30 August 2011 and published 5 September 2011.

**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**


In Liechtenstein, the private sector is especially involved in the development of geographical data and products. Data is almost exclusively created by the private sector for the public administration.

**Policy and legislation on access to public sector information**


Access to public sector information in general is guaranteed by Law no. 172.015 (Gesetz vom 19. Mai 1999 über die Information der Bevölkerung (Informationsgesetz). Directive 2003/98/EC was implemented by the Act of 29 May 2008 on the re-use of public sector information (Gesetz vom 29. Mai 2008 über die Weiterverwendung von Informationen öffentlicher Stellen – Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz). Law no.814.02 on environmental information (Gesetz vom 22. Oktober 1992 über Umweltinformationen) provides access for every citizen to environmental information.


**Legal protection of GI by intellectual property rights**


Act no. 231.1 of 19 May 1999 on Copyright (Gesetz vom 19. Mai 1999 über das Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte (Urheberrechtsgesetz, URG) protects works of literature and art. It explicitly protects photographic works and maps. It replaced the Act of 1928 on Copyright. The 2001/29/EC directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society was implemented through amendments in 2006. <http://web.eftasurv.int/search.aspx?ecRef=2001%2f29> There are no special regulations on legal protection of GI in Liechtenstein. All data of the NSDI are captured and maintained according to a private or public law. 


**Restricted access to GI further to the legal protection of privacy**


In Liechtenstein the law on data protection (235.1) dates from March 14, 2002 and the respective ordinance (235.11) from July 7, 2002 (see [www.gesetze.li](http://www.gesetze.li/)).
