UN-mandated regional bodies are established in the Asia-Pacific, the Americas, Europe, the Arab States and Africa (UN-GGIM activities are presently coordinated in Africa by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)).

The aim of the UN-GGIM-AP is to identify regional issues relevant to geospatial information management and take necessary actions on them for the furtherance of the discussions at UNRCC-AP conferences, and reports back to UN-GGIM. UN-GGIM-AP inherits exactly the same missions and membership as those of PCGIAP. As the representing body of the National Geospatial Information Authority of 56 countries and regions in Asia and the Pacific region, the Committee promotes the unique needs and interests of the region globally while cooperating with other regional and global entities, so that the economic, social and environmental benefits of geospatial information will be maximized in Asia and the Pacific region.

The name change is in keeping with the regional body’s renewed mandate to have increased close cooperation and coordination with UN-GGIM. The aim of the UN-GGIM:Americas is to determine regional issues relevant to the management of geospatial information, in line with the global challenges especially in the context of sustainable development and humanitarian assistance. The Regional Committee aims particularly to take the necessary action on these regional issues resulting from the use of geospatial information based on the member countries’ knowledge and exchange of experiences and technologies to enable the development of the Geospatial Data Infrastructure for the Americas.
